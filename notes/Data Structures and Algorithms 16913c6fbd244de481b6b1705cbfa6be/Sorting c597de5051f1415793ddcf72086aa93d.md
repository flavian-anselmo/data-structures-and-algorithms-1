Sorting is any process of arranging items systematically. In computer science, sorting algorithms put elements of a list in a certain order.

    ```python
    """ 
    1152. Analyze User Website Visit Pattern
    
    You are given two string arrays username and website and an integer array timestamp.
    All the given arrays are of the same length and the tuple [username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]] indicates that the user username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
    A pattern is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).
        For example, ["home", "away", "love"], ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], and ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"] are all patterns.
    The score of a pattern is the number of users that visited all the websites in the pattern in the same order they appeared in the pattern.
        For example, if the pattern is ["home", "away", "love"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited "home" then visited "away" and visited "love" after that.
        Similarly, if the pattern is ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited "leetcode" then visited "love" and visited "leetcode" one more time after that.
        Also, if the pattern is ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"], the score is the number of users x such that x visited "luffy" three different times at different timestamps.
    Return the pattern with the largest score. If there is more than one pattern with the same largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern
    
    Example 1:
        Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
        Output: ["home","about","career"]
        Explanation: The tuples in this example are:
            ["joe","home",1],["joe","about",2],["joe","career",3],["james","home",4],["james","cart",5],["james","maps",6],["james","home",7],["mary","home",8],["mary","about",9], and ["mary","career",10].
            The pattern ("home", "about", "career") has score 2 (joe and mary).
            The pattern ("home", "cart", "maps") has score 1 (james).
            The pattern ("home", "cart", "home") has score 1 (james).
            The pattern ("home", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
            The pattern ("cart", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
            The pattern ("home", "home", "home") has score 0 (no user visited home 3 times).
    Example 2:
        Input: username = ["ua","ua","ua","ub","ub","ub"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6], website = ["a","b","a","a","b","c"]
        Output: ["a","b","a"]
    
    Constraints:
        3 <= username.length <= 50
        1 <= username[i].length <= 10
        timestamp.length == username.length
        1 <= timestamp[i] <= 109
        website.length == username.length
        1 <= website[i].length <= 10
        username[i] and website[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
        It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least three websites.
        All the tuples [username[i], timestamp[i], website[i]] are unique.

    ```python
    """ 
    406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
    
    You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). 
    Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
    Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. 
    The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).
    
    Example 1:
        Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
        Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
        Explanation:
        Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
        Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
        Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
        Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
        Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
        Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
        Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
    Example 2:
        Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
        Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]

## Common operations

### `sort()` parameters (key & reverse)

The syntax of the `sort()` method is:

```python
list.sort(key=..., reverse=...)
```

key

```python
list.sort(key=len)
sorted(list, key=len)
```

```python
# take second element for sort
def takeSecond(elem):
    return elem[1]

# random list
random = [(2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 3)]

# sort list with key
random.sort(key=takeSecond)

# print list
print('Sorted list:', random)
# Sorted list: [(4, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4)]
```

# Bubble Sort

[Bubble Sort Tutorials & Notes | Algorithms | HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/tutorial/)

[Bubble sort in 2 minutes](https://youtu.be/xli_FI7CuzA)

Traverse the input array, **swapping** any two numbers that are out of order and keeping track if you make any swap.
Once you arrive at the end of the array, **check if you have made any swaps**; if not, the array is sorted and you are done; otherwise, repeat the steps laid out in this hint until the array is sorted.

![https://cdn.emre.me/sorting/bubble_sort.gif](https://cdn.emre.me/sorting/bubble_sort.gif)

```python
# Best: O(n) time | O(1) space -> if already sorted
# Average: O(n^2) time | O(1) space
# Worst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space
def bubbleSort(array):
    if len(array) < 2:
        return array

    is_sorted = False
    while not is_sorted:
        is_sorted = True

```

# Insertion Sort

### Examples

Layman explanation

Have to subarrays (in place):

1. Take an element from the second and insert it to the first.
2. Sort the first using something similar to Bubble sort.

Note: seeing the code makes it way easier to understand it

Insertion Sort in Action

![Insertion_sort.gif](Sorting%20c597de5051f1415793ddcf72086aa93d/Insertion_sort.gif)

Divide the input array into two subarrays in place. - The first subarray should be sorted at all times and should start with a length of 1, while the second subarray should be unsorted. 
Iterate through the unsorted subarray, inserting all of its elements into the sorted subarray - in the correct position by swapping them into place. Eventually, the entire array will be sorted. Has like a slow bubble sort (for the sorted array).

Explanation for the code: Start with a 'sorted array' of size one at index 0. Insert the element to the right of the sorted array to the `sorted array` and swap it with other elements till it reaches a balanced position repeat the steps above till you reach the end of the array

```python
# Best: O(n) time | O(1) space -> if already sorted
# Average: O(n^2) time | O(1) space
# Worst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space
def insertionSort(array):

    for i in range(1, len(array)):

        # # insert a new element(array[i]) to the `sorted array`
        # the sorted array will now end at i
        added = i
        while added > 0 and array[added] < array[added-1]:
            # swap
            array[added], array[added-1] = array[added-1], array[added]
            added -= 1

    return array
```

# Selection Sort

Divide the input array into two subarrays in place. The first subarray should be sorted at all times and should start with a length of 0, while the second subarray should be unsorted. 
**Select the smallest (or largest) element** in the unsorted subarray and insert it into the sorted subarray with a swap. Repeat this process of finding the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted subarray and inserting it in its correct position in the sorted subarray with a swap until the entire array is sorted.

# Merge Sort?

Merge sort is a recursive [divide & conquer](_Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions%20e3f5361611c147ebb2fb3eff37a743fd/_Other%2040309fe5fdb74185b00fd1848a50054c/Divide%20and%20Conquer%2032431685f49e4580aea1cb1a41f417a7.md) algorithm that essentially divides a given list into two halves, sorts those halves, and merges them in order. The base case is to merge two lists of size 1 so, eventually, single elements are merged in order; the merge part is where most of the heavy lifting happens.

The time complexity of merge sort is  `nlog(n)`.

Quick sort is the fastest-known, comparison-based sorting algorithm for lists in the average case.It is an algorithm of [Divide & Conquer](_Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions%20e3f5361611c147ebb2fb3eff37a743fd/_Other%2040309fe5fdb74185b00fd1848a50054c/Divide%20and%20Conquer%2032431685f49e4580aea1cb1a41f417a7.md) type.

It has **3** steps:

1. We first select an element which we will call the *pivot* from the array.
2. Move all elements that are *smaller* than the pivot to the *left* of the *pivot*; move all elements that are *larger* than the *pivot* to the *right* of the *pivot*. This is called the **partition operation**.
3. Recursively apply the above 2 steps separately to each of the sub-arrays of elements with *smaller* and *bigger* values than the last pivot.

Quick Sort works by picking a "pivot" number from an array, positioning every other number in the array in sorted order with respect to the pivot (all smaller numbers to the pivot's left; all bigger numbers to the pivot's right), and then repeating the same two steps on both sides of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.

Pick a random number from the input array (the first number, for instance) and let that number be the pivot. Iterate through the rest of the array using two pointers, one starting at the left extremity of the array and progressively moving to the right, and the other one starting at the right extremity of the array and progressively moving to the left. 
As you iterate through the array, compare the left and right pointer numbers to the pivot. 
If the left number is greater than the pivot and the right number is less than the pivot, swap them; this will effectively sort these numbers with respect to the pivot at the end of the iteration. 
If the left number is ever less than or equal to the pivot, increment the left pointer; 
similarly, if the right number is ever greater than or equal to the pivot, decrement the right pointer. 
Do this until the pointers pass each other, at which point swapping the pivot with the right number should position the pivot in its final, sorted position, where every number to its left is smaller and every number to its right is greater.

Repeat the process mentioned on the respective subarrays located to the left and right of your pivot, and keep on repeating the process thereafter until the input array is fully sorted.

# Heap Sort?

[Heap sort in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DmK_H7IdTo)

[Sorting Algorithms with Animations](https://emre.me/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/#heap-sort)

*Heap sort* is the improved version of the [Selection sort](Sorting%20c597de5051f1415793ddcf72086aa93d.md), which takes advantage of a [heap](Heaps%20&%20Priority%20Queues%20bb4a8de1dbe54089854d8d03c833126c.md) data structure rather than a *linear-time search* to find the *max* value item. Using the heap, finding the *next largest element* takes **`O(log(n))`** time, instead of **`O(n)`** for a *linear* scan as in simple selection sort. This allows heap sort to run in **`O(n log(n))`** time, and this is also the *worst case* complexity.
