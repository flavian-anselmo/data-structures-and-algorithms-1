## Introduction

A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, **always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment**. This means that it makes a *locally-optimal* choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a *globally-optimal* solution. They never look backwards at what they’ve done to see if they could *optimise* **globally**. This is the main difference between Greedy and [Dynamic Programming](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753.md).

> Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm in which the solution is built piece by piece. The next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit is chosen. The greedy approach will always make the choice that will maximize the profit and minimize the cost at any given point. It means that a **locally-optimal choice is made in the hope that it will lead to a globally-optimal solution**.
> 

A greedy algorithm builds up a solution by choosing the option that looks the best at every step.

Sometimes *greedy algorithm* fails to find the **optimal** solution because it does *not* consider *all available data* and make choices which *seems best at that moment*. A famous example for this limitation is searching the largest path in a tree.

The **greedy algorithm** fails to solve this problem because it makes decisions *purely* based on what the best answer at the time is: 

at **each** step it did choose the **largest** number and solve the problem as 

**7** -> **12** -> **6** -> **9**. Total is: **34**. 

![This is **not** the optimal solution. Correct solution to this problem is, **7** -> **3** -> **1** -> **99**. Total is: **110**.](Greedy%20Algorithms%20b9b0a6dd66c94e7db2cbbd9f2d6b50af/2019-09-11-greedy-search-path.gif)

This is **not** the optimal solution. Correct solution to this problem is, **7** -> **3** -> **1** -> **99**. Total is: **110**.

A greedy algorithm works if a problem exhibits the following two properties:

1. **Greedy Choice Property*:** A globally optimal solution can be reached at by creating a locally optimal solution. In other words, an optimal solution can be obtained by creating "greedy" choices.
2. **Optimal substructure:** Optimal solutions contain optimal subsolutions. In other words, answers to subproblems of an optimal solution are optimal.

### Examples

- Connect Ropes
- Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
    
    ```python
    """ 
    1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
    
    You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array sticks, where sticks[i] is the length of the ith stick.
    You can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of x + y. 
    You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.
    Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
        Output: 14
        Explanation: You start with sticks = [2,4,3].
            1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
            2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].
            There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.
    Example 2:
        Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
        Output: 30
        Explanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].
            1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
            2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
            3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].
            There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.
    Example 3:
        Input: sticks = [5]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.

    Let's try to repeatedly choose the smallest left-justified partition. 
    Consider the first label, say it's 'a'. 
    The first partition must include it, and also the last occurrence of 'a'. 
    However, between those two occurrences of 'a', there could be other labels that make the minimum size of this partition bigger. 
        For example, in "abccaddbeffe", the minimum first partition is "abccaddb". 
    This gives us the idea for the algorithm: For each letter encountered, process the last occurrence of that letter, extending the current partition [anchor, j] appropriately.

    One quick optimization we can do for the code above is to check the nextPosition from right to left. (jump furthest)
    The theoretical worst case performance is the same, but in practice, for silly examples, the code might run faster. 
    Intuitively, this means we always try to make the biggest jump such that we reach the end as soon as possible
    
    Top-down Dynamic Programming can be thought of as optimized backtracking. 
    It relies on the observation that once we determine that a certain index is good / bad, this result will never change. 
    This means that we can store the result and not need to recompute it every time.

    Top-down to bottom-up conversion is done by eliminating recursion. 
    In practice, this achieves better performance as we no longer have the method stack overhead and might even benefit from some caching. 
    More importantly, this step opens up possibilities for future optimization. 
    The recursion is usually eliminated by trying to reverse the order of the steps from the top-down approach.
    
    The observation to make here is that we only ever jump to the right. 
    This means that if we start from the right of the array, every time we will query a position to our right, that position has already be determined as being GOOD or BAD. 
    This means we don't need to recurse anymore, as we will always hit the memo/cache table.
