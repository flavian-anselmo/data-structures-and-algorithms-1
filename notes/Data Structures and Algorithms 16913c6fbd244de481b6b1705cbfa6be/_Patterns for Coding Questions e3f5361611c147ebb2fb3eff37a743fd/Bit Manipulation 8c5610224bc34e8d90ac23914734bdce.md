XOR is a logical bitwise operator that returns 0 (false) if both bits are the same and returns 1 (true) otherwise. In other words, it only returns 1 if exactly one bit is set to 1 out of the two bits in comparison.

[XOR](Bit%20Manipulation%208c5610224bc34e8d90ac23914734bdce/XOR%20985656fb96144a739ce8ac8e2c447fa0.csv)

### Conversion to binary and back

```python
>>> bin(5)
'0b101'

>>> int('101',2)
5
```

### **Important properties of XOR to remember**

Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

- Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,
    - `1 ^ 1 = 0`
    - `29 ^ 29 = 0`
- Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,
    - `1 ^ 0 = 1`
    - `31 ^ 0 = 31`
- XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:
    - `(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)`
    - `a ^ b = b ^ a`

### Check if right most bit is a one

## Bit shifting

[Algorithms: Bit Manipulation](https://youtu.be/NLKQEOgBAnw?t=279)

![Screenshot 2021-11-11 at 15.09.39.png](Bit%20Manipulation%208c5610224bc34e8d90ac23914734bdce/Screenshot_2021-11-11_at_15.09.39.png)

AÂ **bit shift**Â moves each digit in a number's binary representation left or right. There are three main types of shifts:

### **Left Shifts**

When shifting left, **the most-significant bit is lost**, and aÂ 0Â bit is inserted on the other end.

The left shift operator is usually written as "<<". `**0010 << 1  â†’  0100**`

```python
0010 << 1  â†’  0100
0010 << 2  â†’  1000
```

A single left shift **multiplies a binary number by 2**:

```python
0010 << 1  â†’  0100

0010 is 2
0100 is 4
```

### **Logical Right Shifts**

**This does not exist in python!**

[How to get the logical right binary shift in python](https://stackoverflow.com/q/5832982/10904662)

When shifting right with aÂ **logical right shift**, the least-significant bit is lost and aÂ 0Â is inserted on the other end.

```python
1011 >>> 1  â†’  0101
1011 >>> 3  â†’  0001
```

For positive numbers, a single logical right shift **divides a number by 2**, throwing out any remainders.

```python
0101 >>> 1  â†’  0010

0101 is 5
0010 is 2
```

When shifting right with anÂ **arithmetic right shift**, the least-significant bit is lost and the most-significant bit isÂ *copied*. Languages handle arithmetic and logical right shifting in different ways.Â Java provides two right shift operators: **>> does anÂ *arithmetic*Â right shift** and **>>> does aÂ *logical*Â right shift**. `**1011 >> 1  â†’  1101**`

```python
1011 >> 1  â†’  1101
1011 >> 3  â†’  1111

0011 >> 1  â†’  0001
0011 >> 2  â†’  0000
```

The first two numbers had aÂ 1Â as the most significant bit, so moreÂ 1's were inserted during the shift. The last two numbers had aÂ 0Â as the most significant bit, so the shift inserted more 0's. If a number is encoded usingÂ [two's complement,](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/binary-numbers#twos-complement)Â then ***an arithmetic right shift preserves the number's sign***, while a logical right shift makes the number positive.

**Python uses this by default**

```python
# Arithmetic shift
1011 >> 1  â†’  1101
    1011 is -5
    1101 is -3

# Logical shift
1111 >>> 1  â†’  0111
    1111 is -1
    0111 is  7
```

        1 --> 1
        2 --> 10
        3 --> 11
        4 --> 100
        5 --> 101
