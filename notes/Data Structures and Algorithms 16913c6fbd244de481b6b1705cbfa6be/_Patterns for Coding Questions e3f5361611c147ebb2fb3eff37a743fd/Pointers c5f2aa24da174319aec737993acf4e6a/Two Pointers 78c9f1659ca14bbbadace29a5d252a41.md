[Sum MegaPost - Python3 Solution with a detailed explanation - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/discuss/737096/Sum-MegaPost-Python3-Solution-with-a-detailed-explanation)

In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to **find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints**, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a **pair, a triplet or even a subarray**. For example, take a look at the following problem:

> Given an array of **sorted** numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.
> 

To solve this problem, we can consider each element one by one (pointed out by the first pointer) and iterate through the remaining elements (pointed out by the second pointer) to find a pair with the given sum. The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(N^2) where ‘N’ is the number of elements in the input array. 

Given that the input array is sorted, an efficient way would be to **start with one pointer in the beginning and another pointer at the end**. At every step, we will see if the numbers pointed by the two pointers add up to the target sum. If they do not, we will do one of two things:

![Untitled](Two%20Pointers%2078c9f1659ca14bbbadace29a5d252a41/Untitled.png)

1. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is smaller than the target sum, this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs, we can increment the start-pointer.
2. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is greater than the target sum, this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs, we can decrement the end-pointer.

The time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`.

Two pointers are needed because with just pointer, you would have to continually loop back through the array to find the answer. This back and forth with a single iterator is inefficient for time and space complexity. While the brute force or naive solution with 1 pointer would work, it will produce something along the lines of O(n²). In many cases, two pointers can help you find a solution with better space or runtime complexity.

## Simple problems

### Two sum

""" 
- we need to search for two numbers

- we can have two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end then check how their sum compares to the target
    - if equal, return them
    - if less than, increase the total sum by moving the left pointer forward
    - if greater than, decrease the total sum by moving the right pointer backward

### Remove Duplicates

```python
""" 
Remove Duplicates;

Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. 
You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.

"""

""" 
Solution 1;

- have a res_length variable that will be initialised as 1
- have two pointers both at the start of the array: left & right
- move the right pointer one step forward:
    - if its value is not equal to left's value, increment the value of res_length & move the left pointer to right's position
    - if equal, repeat this step (move the right pointer one step forward)

"""

def remove_duplicates(arr):

    res_length = 1
    last_non_dup = 0
    for idx in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[last_non_dup] != arr[idx]:
            res_length += 1
            last_non_dup = idx
    return res_length

""" 
Solution 2:

In this problem, we need to remove the duplicates in-place such that the resultant length of the array remains sorted. 
As the input array is sorted, therefore, one way to do this is to shift the elements left whenever we encounter duplicates. 
In other words, we will keep one pointer for iterating the array and one pointer for placing the next non-duplicate number. 
So our algorithm will be to iterate the array and whenever we see a non-duplicate number we move it next to the last non-duplicate number we’ve seen.
"""

def remove_duplicates2(arr):
    next_non_duplicate = 1

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[next_non_duplicate - 1] != arr[i]:
            arr[next_non_duplicate] = arr[i]
            next_non_duplicate += 1
        i += 1

    return next_non_duplicate
```

### Squaring a Sorted Array *

```python
""" 
Squaring a Sorted Array:

Given a sorted array, create a new array containing squares of all the numbers of the input array in the sorted order.
"""

""" 
(arrange from largest to smallest then reverse)
- beacause our input array contains negative numbers, 
    the largest square can be either on the far right or far left
- so we need to iterate inwards (from outward):
    - have a left & right pointer at both ends of the array and consider the largest square 

Use two pointers starting at both ends of the input array. 
At any step, whichever pointer gives us the bigger square, 
we add it to the result array and move to the next/previous number according to the pointer.
"""

def make_squares(arr):
    squares = []

    left = 0
    right = len(arr)-1
    while left <= right:
        left_s = arr[left] * arr[left]
        right_s = arr[right] * arr[right]
        if left_s > right_s:
            squares.append(left_s)
            left += 1
        else:
            squares.append(right_s)
            right -= 1

    squares.reverse()

```

## Solution

.

```python
def search_triplets(nums):

    nums.sort()  # will make spotting of duplicates easy

    triplets = []
    length = len(nums)

    for i in range(length-2):  # ignore last two

        # check if element is a duplicate. the first cannot be a duplicate
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            # skip handling an element if it's similar to the one before it
            # because it is sorted, we effectively skip duplicates
            continue

        # TWO SUM for a sorted array
        # 1. find elements that will add up to 0
        # 2. check inner elements

                                # 3. skip similar elements
            else:
                # add elements to triplets
                triplets.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])

                # skip:
                # no need to continue with an element with the same value as l/r
                # Skip all similar to the current left and right so that,
                # when we are moving to the next element, we dont move to an element with the same value
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left+1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right-1]:
                    right -= 1

                # move to inner elements
                left += 1
                right -= 1

    return triplets
```

### Time complexity

Sorting the array will take `O(N log(N))`. The searchPair/twoSum() function will take `O(N)`.

As we are calling searchPair() for every number in the input array, this means that overall searchTriplets() will take `O(N log(N) + N^2)`,which is asymptotically equivalent to `O(N^2)`

### Time & Space complexity

Time

The main for-loop managing the sliding window takes `O(N)` but creating subarrays can take up to `O(N^2)` in the worst case. Therefore overall, our algorithm will take `O(N^3)`

Space 

At most, we need space for `O(n^2)` output lists. At worst, each subarray can take `O(n)` space, so overall, our algorithm’s space complexity will be `O(n^3)`

Insert Interval

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
Return intervals after the insertion.

    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
    If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock),
     design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
    Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
                    Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
    Example 2:
        Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
