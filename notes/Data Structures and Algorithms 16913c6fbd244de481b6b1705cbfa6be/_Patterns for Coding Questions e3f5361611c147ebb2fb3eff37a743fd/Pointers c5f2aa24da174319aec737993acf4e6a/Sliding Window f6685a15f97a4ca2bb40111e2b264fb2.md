### Basic concept

> Your window represents the current section of the string/array that you are ‚Äúlooking at‚Äù and usually there is some information stored along with it in the form of constants. At the very least it will have 2 pointers, one indicating the index corresponding beginning of the window, and one indicating the end of the window.
> 

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something **among all the contiguous subarrays of a given size**.

> Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‚ÄòK‚Äô in it.
> 

Let‚Äôs understand this problem with a real input:

```python
Array:¬†[1,¬†3,¬†2,¬†6,¬†-1,¬†4,¬†1,¬†8,¬†2],¬†K=5
```

Here is the final output containing the averages of all contiguous subarrays of size 5:

```python
Output:¬†[2.2,¬†2.8,¬†2.4,¬†3.6,¬†2.8]
```

A brute-force algorithm will calculate the sum of every 5-element contiguous subarray of the given array and divide the sum by ‚Äò5‚Äô to find the average. Since for every element of the input array, we are calculating the sum of its next ‚ÄòK‚Äô elements, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N*K)` where ‚ÄòN‚Äô is the number of elements in the input array.

Do you see any inefficiency? The inefficiency is that for any two consecutive subarrays of size ‚Äò5‚Äô, the **overlapping part (four elements) will be evaluated twice**. For example, take the above-mentioned input: As you can see, there are four overlapping elements between the subarray (indexed from 0-4) and the subarray (indexed from 1-5). 

![Sliding%20Window%20f6685a15f97a4ca2bb40111e2b264fb2/Screenshot_2021-08-06_at_02.03.16.png](Sliding%20Window%20f6685a15f97a4ca2bb40111e2b264fb2/Screenshot_2021-08-06_at_02.03.16.png)

![Can we somehow reuse the `sum` we have calculated for the overlapping elements?](Sliding%20Window%20f6685a15f97a4ca2bb40111e2b264fb2/Screenshot_2021-08-06_at_02.05.59.png)

Can we somehow reuse the `sum` we have calculated for the overlapping elements?

Can we somehow reuse the `sum` we have calculated for the overlapping elements?

The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize each contiguous subarray as a **sliding window** of ‚Äò5‚Äô elements. This means that we will slide the window by one element when we move on to the next subarray. To reuse the `sum` from the previous subarray, we will subtract the element going out of the window and add the element now being included in the sliding window. This will save us from going through the whole subarray to find the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce to `O(N)`.

### How do you identify them?

There are some common giveaways:

- The problem will involve a data structure that is **ordered and iterable** like an array or a string
- You are looking for some **subrange** in that array/string, like a **longest, shortest or target value**.
- There is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in **O(N¬≤)**, **O(2^N)** or some other large time complexity.

<aside>
üí° The biggest giveaway is that the thing you are looking for is often some kind of optimal, like the **longest sequence** or **shortest sequence** of something that **satisfies a given condition exactly**.

</aside>

---

### Why is this [dynamic programming](../../Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753.md)?

They are a subset of dynamic programming problems, though the approach to solving them is quite different from the one used in solving tabulation or memoization problems. So different in fact, that to a lot of engineers it isn‚Äôt immediately clear that there even is a connection between the two at all.

Not that important btw...

This search for an **optimum** hints at the relationship between sliding window problems and other dynamic problems. You are using the **optimal substructure** property of the problem to guarantee that an optimal solution to a subproblem can be reused to help you find the optimal solution to a larger problem.

You are also using the fact that there are **overlapping subproblems** in the naive approach, to reduce the amount of work you have to do. Take the Minimum Window Substring problem. You are given a string, and a set of characters you need to look for in that string. There might be multiple overlapping substrings that contain all the characters you are looking for, but you only want the shortest one. These characters can also be in any order.

---

## Implementation

One amazing thing about sliding window problems is that most of the time they can be solved in O(N) time and O(1) space complexity.

**Example:**

```python
# find characters in string
String = 'ADOBECODEBANC'
Characters = 'ABC'
```

The naive way to approach this would be to first, scan through the string, looking at ALL the substrings of length 3, and check to see if they contain the characters you‚Äôre looking for. If you can‚Äôt find any of length 3, then try all substrings of length 4, and 5, and 6, and 7 and so on until you reach the length of the string. If you reach that point, you know that those characters are not in there.

This is really inefficient and runs in **O(N¬≤)** time. And what‚Äôs happening is that you are missing out a lot of good information on each pass by constraining yourself to look at fixed length windows, and you‚Äôre re-examining a lot of parts of the string that don‚Äôt need to be re-examined.

**You‚Äôre throwing out a lot of good work, and you‚Äôre redoing a lot of useless work.**

<aside>
üí° This is where the idea of a **window** comes in.

Your window represents the current section of the string/array that you are ‚Äúlooking at‚Äù and usually there is some information stored along with it in the form of constants. At the very least it will have **2 pointers**, one indicating the index corresponding **beginning of the window**, and one indicating the **end of the window**.

But once you have what variables you want to store figured out, all you have to think about then are two things: **When do I grow this window? And when do I shrink it?**

</aside>

## Different Kinds of Windows

There are several kinds of sliding window problems.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/5462/1*xjnJJSEaBa_OsSd2j9U7Wg.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/5462/1*xjnJJSEaBa_OsSd2j9U7Wg.png)

1st pointer/2nd pointer

### **1) Fast/Slow**

These ones have a **fast pointer** that grows your window under a certain condition. So for **[Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)**, you want to grow your window until you have a window that contains **all** the characters you‚Äôre looking for. It will also have a **slow pointer**, that shrinks the window. Once you find a valid window with the fast pointer, you want to start sliding the slow pointer up until you no longer have a valid window.

For example, in the **Minimum Window Substring** problem, once you have a substring that contains all the characters you‚Äôre looking for, then you want to start shrinking it by moving the slow pointer up until you no longer have a valid substring (meaning you no longer have all the characters you‚Äôre looking for)

### 2) Fast/Catchup

This is very similar to the first kind, except, instead of incrementing the slow pointer up, you simply **move it up the fast pointer‚Äôs location** and then keep moving the fast pointer up. It sort of ***jumps*** or ***catches up*** to the index of the fast pointer when a certain condition is met.

This is apparent in the **Max Consecutive Sum problem**. Here you‚Äôre given a list of integers, positive and negative, and you are looking for a consecutive sequence that sums to the largest amount. Key insight: The slow pointer ‚Äújumps‚Äù to the fast pointer‚Äôs index when the current sum ends up being negative. More on how this works later.

For example, in the array: [1, 2, 3, -7, 7, 2, -12, 6] the result would be: 9 (7 + 2)

Again, you‚Äôre looking for some kind of optimum (ie the maximum sum).

### **3) Fast/Lagging**

This one is a little different, but essentially the slow pointer is simply referencing **one or two indices behind** the fast pointer and it‚Äôs keeping track of some choice you‚Äôve made.

For example, in the **[House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)** problem you are trying to see what the maximum amount of gold you can steal from houses that are not next door to each other. Here the choice is whether or not you should steal from the current house, given that you could instead have stolen from the previous house.The **optimum** you are looking for is the maximum amount of gold you can steal.

### **4) Front/Back**

These ones are different because instead of having both pointers traveling from the front, you have one from the front, and the **other from the back**. An example of this is the **Rainwater Problem** where you are calculating the **maximum** amount of rainwater you can capture in a given terrain. Again, you are looking for a maximum value, though the logic is slightly different, you are still optimizing a brute force O(N¬≤) solution.

---

These four patterns should come as no surprise. After all, there are only so many ways you can move two pointers through an array or string in linear time.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/5462/1*uz85ESikbJTtMo1AmKraCg.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/5462/1*uz85ESikbJTtMo1AmKraCg.png)

---

## Look for ‚ÄúKey Insights‚Äù

One final thing to think about with these problems is the key insight that ‚Äúunlocks‚Äù the problem. It usually involves deducing some fact based on the constraints of the problem that helps you look at it in a different way.

For example, in the **House Robber problem**, you can‚Äôt rob adjacent houses, but all houses have a positive amount of gold (meaning you can‚Äôt rob a house and have less gold after robbing it). The key insight here is that the maximum distance between any two houses you rob will be two. If you had three houses between robberies, you could just rob the one in the center of the three and you will be guaranteed to increase the amount of gold you steal.

For the **Bit Flip problem**, you don‚Äôt need to actually mutate the array in the problem, you just need to keep track of how many flips you have remaining. As you grow your window, you subtract from that number until you‚Äôve exhausted all your flips, and then you shrink your window until you encounter a zero and gain a flip back.

# Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

```python
""" 
Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (easy):

Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‚Äòk,‚Äô find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‚Äòk‚Äô.

Example 1:
    Input: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k=3

"""
```

## Solution

If has negative numbers:

A basic brute force solution will be to calculate the sum of all ‚Äòk‚Äô sized subarrays of the given array to find the subarray with the highest sum. We can start from every index of the given array and add the next ‚Äòk‚Äô elements to find the subarray‚Äôs sum. 

If you observe closely, you will realize that to calculate the sum of a contiguous subarray, we can¬†**utilize the sum of the previous subarray**. For this, consider each subarray as a¬†**Sliding Window**¬†of size ‚Äòk.‚Äô¬†To calculate the sum of the next subarray, we need to slide the window ahead by one element. So to slide the window forward and calculate the sum of the new position of the sliding window, we need to do two things:

1. **Subtract the element going out of the sliding window**, i.e., subtract the first element of the window.
2. **Add the new element getting included in the sliding window**, i.e., the element coming right after the end of the window.

This approach will save us from re-calculating the sum of the overlapping part of the sliding window.¬†Here is what our algorithm will look like:

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we can‚Äôt count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
    and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

Example 1:
    Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
    Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
Example 2:
    Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
    Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]
"""
```

## Solution

```python
def dutch_flag_sort(arr):

    next_zero = 0
    next_two = len(arr)-1
    idx = 0
    while idx < (len(arr)):

        # swap values to their correct place
        if arr[idx] == 0 and idx >= next_zero:
            arr[idx], arr[next_zero] = arr[next_zero], arr[idx]
            next_zero += 1
        elif arr[idx] == 2 and idx <= next_two:
            arr[idx], arr[next_two] = arr[next_two], arr[idx]
            next_two -= 1

        # only leave idx if value is in correct place
        else:
            idx += 1
