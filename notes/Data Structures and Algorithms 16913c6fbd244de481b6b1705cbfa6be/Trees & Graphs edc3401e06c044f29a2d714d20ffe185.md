    You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an AncestralTree class that have an ancestor property pointing to their youngest ancestor.

     and the other two inputs are descendants in the ancestral tree.
    Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendants.
    Note that a descendant is considered its own ancestor.
    So in the simple ancestral tree below, the youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A.

- Accounts Merge
    
    ```python
    """ 
    Accounts Merge:
    
    Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, 
    and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
    Now, we would like to merge these accounts. 
    Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. 
    Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. 
    A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
    After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
    
    Example 1:
    
        Input: 
            accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]

            [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
        Explanation:
        The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
        The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
        We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
        ['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

    127. Word Ladder
    
    A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
        Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
        Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
        sk == endWord
    Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, 
        or 0 if no such sequence exists.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
    Example 2:
        Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
    
    Constraints:
        1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
        endWord.length == beginWord.length
        1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
        wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
        beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

- Minimum Passes Of Matrix
    
    ```python
    """ 
    Minimum Passes Of Matrix:
    
    Write a function that takes in an integer matrix of potentially unequal height and width and 
        returns the minimum number of passes required to convert all negative integers in the matrix to positive integers.
    A negative integer in the matrix can only be converted to a positive integer if one or more of its adjacent elements is positive. 
    An adjacent element is an element that is to the left, to the right, above, or below the current element in the matrix. 
    Converting a negative to a positive simply involves multiplying it by -1.
    Note that the 0 value is neither positive nor negative, meaning that a 0 can't convert an adjacent negative to a positive.
    A single pass through the matrix involves converting all the negative integers that can be converted at a particular point in time. 
    For example, consider the following input matrix:
        [ 
        [0, -2, -1], 
        [-5, 2, 0], 
        [-6, -2, 0],
        ]
    
        After a first pass, only 3 values can be converted to positives:
    
        [ 
        [0, 2, -1], 
        [5, 2, 0], 
        [-6, 2, 0],
        ]
    
        After a second pass, the remaining negative values can all be converted to positives:
    
        [ 
        [0, 2, 1], 
        [5, 2, 0], 
        [6, 2, 0],
        ]
    
    Note that the input matrix will always contain at least one element. If the negative integers in the input matrix can't all be converted to positives, regardless of how many passes are run, your function should return -1.
    
    Sample Input
        matrix = [
        [0, -1, -3, 2, 0],
        [1, -2, -5, -1, -3],

- Cycle In Graph

    Cycle In Graph:
    
    You're given a list of edges representing an unweighted, directed graph with at least one node.
    Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the given graph contains a cycle.
    For the purpose of this question, a cycle is defined as any number of vertices, including just one vertex, that are connected in a closed chain.
    A cycle can also be defined as a chain of at least one vertex in which the first vertex is the same as the last.
    
    The given list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph.
    The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of edges, where each index i in edges contains vertex i's outbound edges, in no particular order.
    Each individual edge is represented by a positive integer that denotes an index (a destination vertex) in the list that this vertex is connected to.
    Note that these edges are directed, meaning that you can only travel from a particular vertex to its destination,
     not the other way around (unless the destination vertex itself has an outbound edge to the original vertex).
    Also note that this graph may contain self-loops. A self-loop is an edge that has the same destination and origin;
     in other words, it's an edge that connects a vertex to itself. For the purpose of this question, a self-loop is considered a cycle.

- Remove Islands
    
    ```python
    """
    Remove Islands:
    
    You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s.
    The matrix represents a two-toned image, where each 1 represents black and each 0 represents white. An island is defined as any number of 1s that are horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent) and that don't touch the border of the image. In other words, a group of horizontally or vertically adjacent 1s isn't an island if any of those 1s are in the first row, last row, first column, or last column of the input matrix.
    Note that an island can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.
    You can think of islands as patches of black that don't touch the border of the two-toned image.
    Write a function that returns a modified version of the input matrix, where all of the islands are removed. You remove an island by replacing it with 0s.
    Naturally, you're allowed to mutate the input matrix.

- River Sizes
    
    ```python
    """
    River Sizes:
    
    You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s.
    Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river.
    A river consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent).
    The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its size.
    Note that a river can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.
    Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. 
    The sizes don't need to be in any particular order.
    
    Sample Input
        matrix = [

- Single Cycle Check
    
    ```python
    """
    Single Cycle Check:
    
    You're given an array of integers where each integer represents a jump of its value in the array.
    For instance, the integer 2 represents a jump of two indices forward in the array;
        the integer -3 represents a jump of three indices backward in the array.
    If a jump spills past the array's bounds, it wraps over to the other side. 
    For instance, a jump of -1 at index 0 brings us to the last index in the array. 
    Similarly, a jump of 1 at the last index in the array brings us to index 0.
    
    Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the jumps in the array form a single cycle.

    Shortest Distance from All Buildings
    
    You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:
        each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
        each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
        each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
    
    You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance. 
    You can only move up, down, left, and right.
    
    Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. 
    If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return -1.
    
    The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.
    
    The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
    
    Example 1:
        Input:

        Explanation: 
            Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2).
            The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal.
            So return 7.
    Example 2:

    1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points
    
    You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
    The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
    Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
        Output: 20
    Explanation:
        We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
        Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
    Example 2:
        Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
        Output: 18
    Example 3:
        Input: points = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[-1,1]]
        Output: 4
    Example 4:
        Input: points = [[-1000000,-1000000],[1000000,1000000]]

💡 It’s natural to use a graph when the problem involves spatially connected objects, e.g., road segments between cities.
More generally, consider using a graph when you need to analyze any binary relationship, between objects, such as interlinked webpages, followers in a social graph, etc. In such cases, quite often the problem can be reduced to a well-known graph problem.

<aside>
💡 Some graph problems entail analysing structure, e.g., looking for cycles or connected components. ***[DFS](Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98.md)*** works particularly well for these applications

DFS is often preferred **if we want to visit every node in the graph**. Both will work just fine, but the depth-first search is a bit simpler.

💡 Some graph problems are related to **optimisation**, e.g., finding the shortest path from one vertex to another. **[BFS](Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98.md), Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm,** and **minimum spanning tree** are examples of graph algorithms appropriate for optimisation problems.

## Terminology & Definitions

![a directed, weighted, acyclic graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/graph.png)

a directed, weighted, acyclic graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges

### **Vertex/Node**

A [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_%28graph_theory%29) (also called a **node**) is a fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name (a **key**), it may also have additional information (the **payload**). Our graph has **6** vertices: `V = {a, b, c, d, e, f}`

### **Edge/Arc**

An [edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge) (also called an “**arc**”) is another fundamental part of a graph. An **edge** connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Our graph has **8** edges: `E = {(a, b, 45), (a, c, 52), (a, d, 7), (b, c, 11), (b, f, 5), (d, e, 17), (e, f, 6), (f, c, 21)}`

### **Weighted or Unweighted**

If a graph is **weighted**, each edge has a “weight.” The weight could, for example, represent the distance between two locations, or the cost or time it takes to travel between the locations.

### **Directed or Undirected**

In **directed** graphs, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. In **undirected** graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

Our example above is a **directed graph**.

### **Cyclic or Acyclic**

A graph is **cyclic** if it has a cycle, an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are **acyclic**. Our example above is an **acyclic graph**.

### Connected vs Disconnected

If G is an undirected graph, vertices u and v are said to be ***connected*** if G contains a path from u to v; otherwise, u and v are said to be ***disconnected***.

A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. 
A connected component is a maximal set of vertices C such that each pair of vertices in C is connected in G. E

### Topological ordering

[Topological Sort (for graphs) *](_Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions%20e3f5361611c147ebb2fb3eff37a743fd/Trees%20&%20Graphs%20(Additional%20content)%200fcf8228f7574bfc90076f33e9e274e0/Topological%20Sort%20(for%20graphs)%20e35d20a5223f4c50b4a73c0f71dc2c07.md)

A ***directed acyclic graph*** (DAG) is a directed graph in which there are no cycles, i.e., paths that contain one or more edges and which begin and end at the same vertex.

Vertices in a directed acyclic graph that have no incoming edges are referred to as ***sources**.*

Vertices that have no outgoing edges are referred to as ***sinks***. 

***Indegree*** → count of incoming edges of each vertex/node or how many parents it has (used to determine sources)

## **Representing Graphs in Code**

There are a few ways to represent graphs in the code. We’ll look at the most common **three**, and the *basic tradeoffs*.

Let’s take this graph as an example:

![https://cdn.emre.me/2019-09-15-graph-code.png](https://cdn.emre.me/2019-09-15-graph-code.png)

### **Edge List**

A list of all the edges in the graph: `graph =  [[4, 5], [2, 4], [2, 3], [1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1]]` Since node **0** has edges to nodes **1** and **2**, `[0, 1]` and `[0, 2]` are in the edge list.

This is well suited to performant **lookups of an edge**, or **listing all edges**, but is slow with many other query types. For example, to find all vertices adjacent to a given vertex, every edge must be examined.

### **Adjacency List (Use of indexes & dicts) ***

A list where the **index** *represents the node* and the **value at that index** is a list of the *node’s neighbours*: Since node **2** has edges to nodes **0**, **1**, **3** and **4**, `graph[2]` has the adjacency list `[0, 1, 3, 4]`.

We could also use a dictionary where the **keys** *represent the node* and the **values** are the *lists of neighbours*. This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn’t map cleanly to list indices.

`graph = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 2],
    [0, 1, 3, 4],
    [2],
    [2, 5],
    [4]
]`

`graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1, 3, 4],
    3: [2],
    4: [2, 5],
    5: [4]
}`

This representation allows for **constant-time lookup of adjacent vertices**, which is useful in many **query** and **pathfinding** scenarios. It is **slower for edge lookups**, as the whole list of vertices adjacent to `u` must be examined for `v`, in order to find edge `uv`.

[Adjacency lists](https://emre.me/data-structures/graphs/#adjacency-list) are the typical choice for **general purpose** use, though [edge lists](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md) or [adjacency matrices](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md) have their own strengths, which may match a specific use case.

Pros:

- **Saves on space** (memory): the representation takes as many memory words as there are nodes and edge.

Cons:

- It **can take up to O(n) time to determine if a pair of nodes (i,j) is an edge**: one would have to search the linked list L[i], which takes time proportional to the length of L[i].

### **Adjacency Matrix ***

A matrix of **0** and **1** indicates whether node *x* connects to node *y* (**0** means *no*, **1** means *yes*).

Since node **4** has edges to nodes **2** and **5**, `graph[4][2]` and `graph[4][5]` have value **1**.

Pros:

- Simple to implement
- **O(1) edge lookups**. Easy and fast to tell if a pair (i,j) is an edge: simply check if A[i][j] is 1 or 0

Cons:

- No matter how few edges the graph has, the matrix takes **O(n2) in memory**

`graph = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]`    

Adjacency matrices perform strongly with **edge lookups**, with a **constant-time lookup** given a pair of vertex `Id`. They tend to be slow for other operations. For example, listing everything adjacent to a vertex requires checking every single vertex in the graph. They also typically **require more space than other models**, especially with sparse graphs (graphs with “few” edges)

    785. Is Graph Bipartite?
    
    There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. 
    You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. 
    More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:
        There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
        There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
        If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
        The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
    
    A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets 
     A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
    
    Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.

Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.

    The key observation to make is: 
        the longest path has to be between two leaf nodes. 
    We can prove this with contradiction. 
    Imagine that we have found the longest path, and it is not between two leaf nodes. 
    We can extend that path by 1, by adding the child node of one of the end nodes (as at least one must have a child, given that they aren't both leaves). 
    This contradicts the fact that our path is the longest path. Therefore, the longest path must be between two leaf nodes.
    
    Moreover, we know that in a tree, nodes are only connected with their parent node and 2 children. 
    Therefore we know that the longest path in the tree would consist of a node, its longest left branch, and its longest right branch. 
    So, our algorithm to solve this problem will find the node where the sum of its longest left and right branches is maximized. 
    This would hint at us to apply Depth-first search (DFS) to count each node's branch lengths, 
     because it would allow us to dive deep into the leaves first, and then start counting the edges upwards.

    Max Path Sum In Binary Tree:
    Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum:
    
    A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. 
    A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
    The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
    Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.
    
    Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.
    A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected to more than two other nodes;
     a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path.
    Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
    Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.

    Find Successor:
    
    Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree (where nodes have an additional pointer to their parent node)
     as well as a node contained in that tree and returns the given node's successor.
    A node's successor is the next node to be visited (immediately after the given node) 
     when traversing its tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique.
    A node has no successor if it's the last node to be visited in the in-order traversal.
    If a node has no successor, your function should return None / null.
    Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a parent node, a left child node, and a right child node.
    Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.

    Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
    
    Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
        or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
    Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
    There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
    You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
    Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree.

    You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.
    The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis.
    The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.
    You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

    Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III:
    
    Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
    Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:
        class Node {
            public int val;
            public Node left;
            public Node right;

    According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
        "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node 
            that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."
    
    Example 1:
        Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
    Example 2:
        Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
        Output: 5
        Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

    Find Nodes Distance K:
    
    You're given the root node of a Binary Tree, a target value of a node that's contained in the tree, and a positive integer k. 
    Write a function that returns the values of all the nodes that are exactly distance k from the node with target value.
    The distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges that must be traversed to go from one node to the other. 
    For example, the distance between a node and its immediate left or right child is 1. The same holds in reverse: the distance between a node and its parent is 1. In a tree of three nodes where the root node has a left and right child, the left and right children are distance 2 from each other.
    
    Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
    
    Note that all BinaryTree node values will be unique, and your function can return the output values in any order.

    tree = 1

### Definition of terms

The ***depth*** of a node n is the number of nodes on the search path from the root to n, not including n itself. 
The ***height*** of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in that tree. 
A ***level*** of a tree is all nodes at the same depth.

***Balanced vs. Unbalanced***

A ***balanced* binary tree**, also referred to as a **height-balanced binary tree**, is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by **not more than 1**. One way to think about it is that a "balanced" tree really means something more like "**not terribly imbal­anced**:" It's balanced enough to ensure 0(logn) times for insert and find,but it's not necessarily as balanced as it could be.

While many trees are balanced, not all are. Ask your interviewer for clarification here. Note that balancing a tree does not mean the left and right subtrees are exactly the same size (like you see under "perfect binary trees").

Two common types of balanced trees are **red-black trees** and **AVL trees.**

***Complete Binary Trees***

![Screenshot 2021-10-06 at 18.20.21.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-10-06_at_18.20.21.png)

A ***complete binary tree*** is a binary tree in which every level, except
possibly the last, **is completely filled**, and all nodes are **as far left as possible** (This terminology is not universal, e.g., some authors use complete binary tree where we write perfect binary tree.)

***Full Binary Trees***

![Screenshot 2021-10-06 at 18.21.20.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-10-06_at_18.21.20.png)

A ***full binary tree*** is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

***Perfect binary tree***

A ***perfect binary tree*** is a full binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth, and in which every parent has two children. (every level of the tree is completely full) 

Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they're perfect:

1. The number of total nodes on each "level" doubles as we move down the tree.
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 10.01.10.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_10.01.10.png)
    
2. The number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1). In other words, about half of our nodes are on the last level.

## Binary Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)

We can use [DFS](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md) to do `pre-order`, `in-order` and `post-order` traversal. There is a common feature among these three traversal orders: we never trace back unless we reach the deepest node. That is also the largest difference between [DFS and BFS](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md), BFS never go deeper unless it has already visited all nodes at the current level. Typically, we implement DFS using recursion.

### **Pre-order Traversal (nlr)**

In this traversal mode, one starts from the ***root***, move to *left child*, then *right child*.

### **In-order Traversal (lnr)**

[Screen Recording 2021-10-23 at 13.31.41.mov](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screen_Recording_2021-10-23_at_13.31.41.mov)

In this traversal mode, one starts visiting with the ***left** child*, followed by *root* and then the *right child*.

Check out [how to do it iteratively](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md). 

### **Post-order Traversal (lrn)**

In this traversal mode, **one starts from the *left child*, move to the *right child***, and terminate at the *root*.

    Binary Search Tree Iterator:
    
    Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):
    BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. 
    The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
    boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
    int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.
    Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.
    You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.

    Given a node in a binary search tree, return the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

    Node has no right child, then its successor is somewhere upper in the tree. 
    To find the successor, go up till the node that is left child of its parent. The answer is the parent.

    You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
    The encoded string should be as compact as possible.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: root = [2,1,3]
        Output: [2,1,3]
    Example 2:
        Input: root = []
        Output: []

    Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
    
    Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
        or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
    Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
    There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
    You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
    Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. 
    You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
        Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
    Example 2:
        Input: root = []
        Output: []
    Example 3:
        Input: root = [1]
        Output: [1]
    Example 4:
        Input: root = [1,2]
        Output: [1,2]

- Find Kth Largest Value In BST
    
    ```python
    """
    Find Kth Largest Value In BST:
    
    Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive integer k and returns the kth largest integer contained in the BST.
    You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that k is less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
    Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as distinct values.
    In other words, the second largest value in a BST containing values {5, 7, 7} will be 7—not 5.
    Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
    A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: 
        its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right;
         and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.

    The pre-order traversal of a Binary Tree is a traversal technique that starts at the tree's root node and visits nodes in the following order:
        Current node
        Left subtree
        Right subtree
    Given a non-empty array of integers representing the pre-order traversal of a Binary Search Tree (BST),
        write a function that creates the relevant BST and returns its root node.

    Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree.

    You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

    Binary Search Tree Iterator:
    
    Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):
    BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class. 
    The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
    boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
    int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.
    Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.
    You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.
    
    Example 1:
         7
        / \
        3  15
           / \
           9  20

    Output

    Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.
    You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. 
    For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.
    We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, 
     and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.

The **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a [Binary Tree](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md) with the following properties.

1. Keys that are **less than** the *parent* are found in the **left subtree**
2. Keys that are **greater than or equal to** the *parent* are found in the **right subtree**
3. Both the **left** and **right** subtrees must also be *binary search trees*.

## **Binary Search Tree Operations**

Key lookup, insertion, and deletion take time proportional to the height of the tree, which can in **worst-case be `O(n)`**, if insertions and deletions are naively implemented. However, there are implementations of insert and delete which guarantee that the tree has height `O(log n)`. These require storing and updating additional data at the tree nodes. **Red-black trees** are an example of height-balanced BSTs and are widely used in data structure libraries.

💡 Key lookup, insertion, and deletion take time proportional to the height of the tree, which can in **worst-case be `O(n)`**, if insertions and deletions are naively implemented. Eg if the tree looks like a linked list

</aside>

When we are talking about the *average case*, it is the time it takes for the operation on a **balanced tree**, and when we are talking about the *worst case*, it is the time it takes for the given operation on a **non-balanced tree**.

These are discussed in more depth [below](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md).

    ```
    

### Insert Operation

We have a `Node()` and `BinarySearchTree()` classes, we are ready to **insert** elements to this `BinarySearchTree()` class.

We are going to implement a `put(self, key, val)` method. This method will check to see if the tree already has a *root*. If there is not a *root* then `put()` will create a new `Node()` and *install* it as the *root* of the tree. If a root node is already in place then `put()` calls the private, recursive, helper function `_put()` to search the tree according to the *Binary Search Tree* properties that we explained in the first paragraph of this article.

- Code
    
    ```python
    def put(self, key, val):
        if self.root:
            self._put(key, val, self.root)
        else:
            self.root = Node(key, val)
        self.size = self.size + 1
    
    def _put(self, key, val, current_node):
        if key < current_node.key:
            if current_node.has_left_child():
                self._put(key, val, current_node.leftChild)
            else:
                current_node.leftChild = Node(key, val, parent=current_node)
        else:
            if current_node.has_right_child():
                self._put(key, val, current_node.rightChild)
            else:
                current_node.rightChild = Node(key, val, parent=current_node)
    
    def __setitem__(self, k, v):
        self.put(k, v)
    ```
    

### Lookup (Search) Operation

Once the tree is constructed, the next task is to implement the retrieval of a value for a given key. The `get()` method is even easier than the `put()` method because it simply searches the tree recursively until it gets to a non-matching leaf node or finds a matching key. When a matching key is found, the value stored in the payload of the node is returned.

- Code
    
    ```python
    def get(self, key):
        if self.root:
            result = self._get(key, self.root)
            if result:
                return result.payload
            else:
                return None
        else:
            return None
    
    def _get(self, key, current_node):
        if not current_node:
            return None
        elif current_node.key == key:
            return current_node
        elif key < current_node.key:
            return self._get(key, current_node.leftChild)
        else:
            return self._get(key, current_node.rightChild)
    
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self.get(key)
    
    def __contains__(self, key):
        if self._get(key, self.root):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    ```
    

### Delete Operation

`delete()` operation is the most challenging operation in the *Binary Search Tree*.

![Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 12.46.07.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-11-09_at_12.46.07.png)

The first task is to find the *node to delete* **by searching the tree**. If the tree has more than one node we search using the `_get()` method to find the `Node()` that needs to be *removed*. If the tree only has a single node, that means we are removing the *root* of the tree, but we still must check to make sure the key of the root matches the key that is to be deleted. In either case if the key is not found the `delete()` method raises an error.

Once we have found the node containing the key we want to *delete*, there are **three cases** that we must consider:

1. The node to be deleted has **no** children
2. The node to be deleted has **only one** child
3. The node to be deleted has **two** children

![1. The node to be deleted has **no** children](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/2019-08-27-deleting-node-without-children.png)

1. The node to be deleted has **no** children

![2. The node to be deleted has **only one** child](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Untitled.png)

2. The node to be deleted has **only one** child

[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)

1. Handling the first case is pretty easy ↑
2. ← If a node has only a **single child**, then we can simply promote the child to take the place of its parent.The decision proceeds as follows:
    1. If the **current node is a left child** then we only need to **update** the *parent* reference of the *left child* to point to the *parent* of the *current node*, and then **update** the *left child* reference of the *parent* to point to the *current node’s left child*.
    2. If the current node is a **right child** then we only need to **update** the *parent* reference of the *left child* to point to the *parent* of the *current node*, and then **update** the *right child* reference of the *parent* to point to the *current node’s left child*.
    3. If the current node has **no parent**, it must be the *root*. In this case we will just **replace** the `key`, `payload`, `leftChild`, and `rightChild` data by calling the `replace_node_data()` method on the `root`.

1. If a node has **two** children, we *search the tree* for a node that can be used to replace the one scheduled for deletion. What we need is a node that will *preserve the binary search tree relationships* for both of the existing *left* and *right* subtrees. The node that will do this is the node that has the next-largest key in the tree. We call this node the **successor. There are three cases to consider when looking for a successor:** 
    1. If the node has **a** *right child*, then the *successor* is the **smallest key** in the *right subtree*
    2. If the node has **no** *right child* and is the *left child* of its parent, then the *parent* is the *successor*
    3. If the node **is** the *right child* of its *parent*, and itself has **no** *right child*, then the *successor* to this node is the *successor* of its *parent*, excluding this node.

    1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points
    
    You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
    The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
    Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
        Output: 20
    Explanation:
        We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
        Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
    Example 2:
        Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
        Output: 18
    Example 3:
        Input: points = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[-1,1]]
        Output: 4
    Example 4:

## Minimum Spanning Tree

A ***minimum spanning tree*** (or ***MST*** *for* short) is a tree that spans the whole graph **connecting all nodes** together *while* **minimising the total edge cost**. It's important to note that your spanning tree cannot contain any cycles, otherwise it's not a tree.

Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a **weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree**. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

By nature, it's a greedy algorithm that always selects the next best edge to add to the MST and it works very well on dense graphs with lots of edges.

### Lazy Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

Maintain a ***Priority Queue*** that sorts edges based on minimum edge cost. This PQ is used to **tell you which node to go to next** and **what edge was used to get there**. Then the algorithm begins and we start on any starting node s and mark s as visited and iterate over all its edges and add them to the PQ. From this point on, while the PQ is not empty and an MST has not been formed, dequeue the next best edge from the PQ. If the dequeued edge is not outdated which it could be if we visit the node it points to via another path before getting to this edge then mark the current node as visited and add the selected edge to the PQ. If you selected a stale outdated edge simply poll again. Then repeat the process of iterating over the current node's edges and adding them to the PQ. While doing this care not to add edges that point to already visited nodes, this will reduce the number of outdated edges in the PQ.

### Eager Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

[Eager Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm | Graph Theory](https://youtu.be/xq3ABa-px_g)

The lazy implementation of Prim’s inserts `E` edges into the PQ. This results in each poll operation on the PQ to be `O(log(E))`. In the eager version, we maintain the idea that instead of adding edges to the PQ which could later become stale, that instead, we should track `(node, edge)` key-value pairs that can easily be updated and polled to determine the next best edge to add to the MST.

For this all to make sense there's a **key realisation** that needs to happen and that is: for any MST with directed edges, each node is **paired with exactly one of its incoming edges** (except for the start node). One way to see this is on an MST with possibly multiple edges leaving a node, but only ever one edge entering a node.

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 06.34.57.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_06.34.57.png)

In the eager version, we are trying to determine which of a node's incoming edges we should select to include in the MST. The main difference coming from the lazy version is that instead of adding edges to the PQ as we iterate over the edges of node we’re going to relax (update) the destination node’s most promising incoming edge.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm

[Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm | Graph Theory](https://youtu.be/pSqmAO-m7Lk)

[Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm - A Detailed and Visual Introduction](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/)

[Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/dijkstra-algorithm)

[Dijkstra's Algorithm vs Prim's Algorithm](https://youtu.be/K_1urzWrzLs)

[Graphs in Python: Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://stackabuse.com/dijkstras-algorithm-in-python/)

With Dijkstra's Algorithm, you can find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Particularly, you can find the shortest path from a node (called the "source node") to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

![Dr.Edsger Dijkstra at ETH Zurich in 1994](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Untitled%202.png)

Dr.Edsger Dijkstra at ETH Zurich in 1994

Dijkstra's Algorithm can only work with graphs that have **positive** weights. This is because, during the process, the weights of the edges have to be added to find the shortest path.

If there is a negative weight in the graph, then the algorithm will not work properly. Once a node has been marked as "visited", the current path to that node is marked as the shortest path to reach that node. And negative weights can alter this if the total weight can be decremented after this step has occurred.

The Disjoint set uses chaining to define a set. The chaining is defined as a parent-child relationship.

## Introduction

[Segment Tree](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/segment-tree-640d1e0fee6f)

A ***segment tree*** is a very flexible data structure, because it is used to solve numerous range query problems like finding minimum, maximum, sum, greatest common divisor, least common denominator in array in logarithmic time.

![Screenshot 2021-11-12 at 11.17.08.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-11-12_at_11.17.08.png)

Let’s say we have an array **A** of size **N**. A **segment** of the array is a contiguous part of an array in form **`A[i:j]`** A **segment tree** is essentially a binary tree in whose nodes we store the information about the segments of a linear data structure such as an array. Do not worry about what kind of information as of now. We shall take a look at that later.

- The root node of the segment tree would contain the information about segment **`A[0:N-1]`**
- The left child of the root node would contain the information about segment **`A[0:(N-1)/2]`** and similarly,
- The right child of the root node would contain the information about segment 
**`A[ 1+((N-1)/2) : (N-1) ]`** and so on.

In simpler terms the **root node** contains **information about the whole array**, its **left child** contains a similar kind of information about the **left half of the array**, and the **right child** of the root node will contain the information about the **right half of the array** and so on. Thus at each step (level of the tree), we divide the segment into two halves and the further children nodes contain the information about these two halves. This continues till we reach the **leaf nodes** which contain the element of the array **A** itself. The **`i-th`** leaf node contains **`A[i]`**. Thus we can say that there will be **N** leaf ****nodes and the height of the tree will be log **N** to the base 2.

---

> **Note:** Once a segment tree is built for an array, its structure cannot be changed. We are allowed to update the values of the nodes but we cannot change the structure of the Segment Tree. That is to say, we cannot add more elements to the array and expect the segment tree to update. In that case, we will have to create a new segment tree altogether. However, we are allowed to update the values of the array and the segment tree shall be updated accordingly.
> 

Segment Trees allow for the following two operations:

- **Update:** This operation allows us to update the values of array **A** and reflect the corresponding changes in the segment tree.
- **Query:** This operation allows us to perform a range query on the array. For example, let's say we have an array of size 15 and we wish to find the maximum element in the segment of an array with start index as **3** and end index **9**. This is an example of a range query.

Thus we can say that a segment tree comes in handy when we have a lot of range-based queries to be performed on an array along with value updates on the same array. The process of creation of a segment tree takes some time but once it's done, the operation of range queries becomes very fast.

### **What kind of information does a segment tree hold?**

Now that we have a basic understanding of the structure of the segment tree let us have a look at what kind of information does a segment tree hold. Consider an array `A = [1, 4, 5, 8, 0, 13]`

Now a segment tree is always associated with a piece of certain information that is directly linked with the kind of range queries we wish to perform. A couple of them are as follows:

- Find the **sum/product** of elements of an array in the range `A[i:j]`
- Find the **maximum/minimum** element in the range `A[i:j]`
- Find the **count of even/odd/prime** etc, numbers in the range `A[i:j]`

There can be many others depending upon the usage. Let us have a look at how we can make use of a segment tree to find the **sum of elements in a given range**.

### Construction

[Screen Recording 2021-11-12 at 12.03.56.mov](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screen_Recording_2021-11-12_at_12.03.56.mov)

Let’s say we have an array `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` ****and we wish to find the sum of elements in a given range. Then each node would store the sum of its children nodes, except the leaf nodes which store the array elements. Then the segment tree for the same would look something like this:

![Untitled](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Untitled%203.png)

The red node being the root node, the blue nodes being the internal nodes and the green nodes being the leaf nodes. Each node contains information about a particular segment of the array. In this example,

- Root node contains the sum of all the elements of the array
- The left child of the root node contains the information about the sum of the left half of the array i.e. **[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**. Its left child in turn contains the sum of the segment **[1, 2, 3]** and the right child contains the sum of the segment **[4, 5]** and so on.
- The right child of the root node contains the information about the sum of the left half of the array i.e. **[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]**. Its left child in turn contains the sum of the segment **[6, 7, 8]** and the right child contains the sum of the segment **[9, 10]** and so on.

If we wanted to compute, let's say, the maximum element then we would be storing the maximum element in each segment in the corresponding nodes. Thus before building the Segment Tree one must figure out the intent behind building the tree and the type of values to be stored in the tree’s nodes.

> Thus we can also notice that a segment tree is always going to be a [*full binary tree*](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185.md) i.e. each node either has 2 or 0 children.

The total number of leaf nodes is at least N. Total number of internal nodes = N-1. So, the total number of nodes = 2*N-1. But generally, to build a segment tree over an array of size N, we use a tree of **4*N nodes**. (Why?)

Array representation of above segment tree will be

```cpp
Tree[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,dummy,dummy,10,11,dummy,dummy};
```

Since we use the array representation of the segment tree, so a bit of space is wasted as you can see in the above example. This wasted space can be removed but in that case, its implementation would be more complex. Considering these waste spaces, for the smooth working of data structure, a tree of **size 4*N** is used, which is still of **linear space complexity.**

**4*N size is enough for an array of size N. Why?**

```cpp
void build(int node, int start, int end)
{
    if(start == end)
    {
        // Leaf node will have a single element
        tree[node] = A[start];
    }
    else
    {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;

        // Recurse on the left child
        build(2*node, start, mid);
        // Recurse on the right child
        build(2*node+1, mid+1, end);

        // Internal node will have the sum of both of its children
        tree[node] = tree[2*node] + tree[2*node+1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
void Build_Tree(int node, int st, int end)
{
	if(st == end)
	{
		/*Leaf node will store the single array element*/
		tree[node] = A[st];
		return ;
	}
	int mid = (st+end)/2;
	
	/*Call recursion for left child*/
	Build_Tree(node*2, st, mid);
	
	/*Call recursion for right child*/	
	Build_Tree(node*2+1, mid+1, end);
		
	/*Update the current node as minimum of both children*/
	tree[node] = min(tree[2*node], tree[2*node+1]);
	return;
}
```

![Screenshot 2021-11-12 at 11.28.39.png](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screenshot_2021-11-12_at_11.28.39.png)

In the above function, **node** represents the current node of the tree being processed and variables **st** and **end** represent the range (segment) of that current node. Recall that segment tree is a binary tree, left child, given by ***2*node***, contains the range A[st : mid] and right child, which is given by ***2*node+1***, contains the range A [mid+1: end] where mid=(st+end)/2.

Since the build function is being called once for each node (total maximum 4*N node), so the time complexity of the **build()** is **O(N)**.

### **Update the Tree**

[Screen Recording 2021-11-12 at 12.05.24.mov](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screen_Recording_2021-11-12_at_12.05.24.mov)

Now, we want to modify the array element as **A[a] = b** and hence we have to modify the segment tree. Looking at the tree, one can clearly observe that index to be updated lies only in one segment of each level so we need to update only **log(N)** nodes. Starting from the root node we will recursively call the update function for the node which contains required index till we reach the leaf node representing that index. Then we will update that node, and in backtracking all the ancestors till root will be updated as minimum of its children.

Code for the same is:

```cpp
void update(int node, int start, int end, int idx, int val)
{
    if(start == end)
    {
        // Leaf node
        A[idx] += val;
        tree[node] += val;
    }
    else
    {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if(start <= idx and idx <= mid)
        {
            // If idx is in the left child, recurse on the left child
            update(2*node, start, mid, idx, val);
        }
        else
        {
            // if idx is in the right child, recurse on the right child
            update(2*node+1, mid+1, end, idx, val);
        }
        // Internal node will have the sum of both of its children
        tree[node] = tree[2*node] + tree[2*node+1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
void update(int node, int st, int end, int idx, int value)
{
	if(st == end)
	{
		/*Update leaf node*/
		tree[node] = value;
		A[idx] = value;
		return ;
	}
	
	int mid = (st+end)/2;
	/*if index lies in the left child call update() for left child*/
	if(idx<=mid)
	  update(2*node, st, mid, idx, value);
	
	/*else index would lie in the right child, call update() for the right child*/
	else
		update(2*node+1, mid+1, end, idx, value);
	
	/*after updating the children,update the current node as smallest of its children */
	tree[node] = min(tree[2*node], tree[2*node+1]);
	return ;
}
```

TIme complexity of update function is **O(log(N))**.

**P.S.** *Often we don’t need to write one special **build()** function for building the segment tree. It can be done using the update function as well. For that we need to initialize the tree nodes with such a value that will never affect our answer*.

### Range **query**

[Screen Recording 2021-11-12 at 12.05.58.mov](Trees%20&%20Graphs%20edc3401e06c044f29a2d714d20ffe185/Screen_Recording_2021-11-12_at_12.05.58.mov)

We are given two integers l and r, we need to find the smallest element in this range (l and r inclusive).

To accomplish the task, we will traverse the segment tree and use the pre-computed values of the intervals. Let’s consider that currently, we are at a vertex that covers the interval A[st, st+1, st+2, . . ., end]. Then there are three possibilities:

- **Range represented by the node lies completely inside the given query range:** In this case, we will just return the value stored at that node in the segment tree.
- **The range represented by the node lies completely outside the given query range:** In this case, the query function should return such a value that will not affect our answer. For example, if we want to find the minimum element, our function should return infinity (**INT_MAX**).
- **Range represented by the node lies partially inside and partially outside the given query range:** As in this case, our answer depends on both the children so we will make two recursive calls one for each child. Let’s say partial answer from left child is ans1 and that from right child is ans2, so our answer would be min(ans1, ans2).

<aside>
💡 To query on a given range, check 3 conditions:
- Range represented by a node is completely inside the given range
- Range represented by a node is completely outside the given range
- Range represented by a node is partially inside and partially outside the given range

</aside>

```cpp
int query(int node, int start, int end, int l, int r)
{
    if(r < start or end < l)
    {
        // range represented by a node is completely outside the given range
        return 0;
    }
    if(l <= start and end <= r)
    {
        // range represented by a node is completely inside the given range
        return tree[node];
    }
    // range represented by a node is partially inside and partially outside the given range
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    int p1 = query(2*node, start, mid, l, r);
    int p2 = query(2*node+1, mid+1, end, l, r);
    return (p1 + p2);
}
```

```cpp
int range_min_query(int node, int st, int end, int l, int r)
{
	/*if range of the current node lies inside the query range*/
	if(l <= st && end <= r )
	{
		return tree[node];
	}
	/*If current range is completely outside the query range*/
	if(st>r || end<l)
	return INT_MAX;
	
  /*If query range intersects both the children*/
	int mid = (st+end)/2;
	int ans1 = range_min_query(2*node, st, mid, l, r);
	int ans2 = range_min_query(2*node+1, mid+1, end, l, r);	
	return min(ans1, ans2);	
}
```

**Time Complexity:** Since at any level at most 4 nodes will be visited and the total number of levels in the tree is log(N). The upper bound of all the visited nodes would be 4*log(N). Hence, the time complexity of each query would be **O(log(N).**
