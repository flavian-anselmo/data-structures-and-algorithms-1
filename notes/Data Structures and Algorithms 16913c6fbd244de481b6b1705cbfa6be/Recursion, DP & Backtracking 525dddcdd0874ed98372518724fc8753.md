Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.

[Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/fixing_problems.webp](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/fixing_problems.webp)

When do you use recursion? making one choice, then one after that, on and on. Or in hierarchies, networks and graphs.

Recursive strategy:

- **Order your data** (not necessarily via code - just conceptually)
    
    Helps in identifying the base case
    
    ---
    
    Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:
    
    ```python
    # Factorial
    n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
    n! = n x (n−1)!
    
    # Fibonacci
    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ![Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/1__iWRR40_qag60phm7gyn5Q.gif](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/1__iWRR40_qag60phm7gyn5Q.gif)
    
    Whatever data we are operating on, whether it is numbers, strings, lists, binary trees or people, it is necessary to explicitly find an appropriate ordering that gives us a direction to move in to **make the problem smaller**. This ordering depends entirely on the problem, but a good start is to think of the obvious orderings: numbers come with their own ordering, strings and lists can be ordered by their length, binary trees can be ordered by depth.
    
    Once we’ve ordered our data, we can think of it as something that we can reduce. In fact, we can write out our ordering as a sequence:
    
    - *0*, *1*, *2*, …, *n* for integers (i.e. for integer data *d*, *degree(d) = d*)
    Moving from right to left we move through the general (‘big’) cases, to the base (‘little’) cases
    - [], [■], [■, ■], …, [■, … , ■] for lists(notice len = 0, len = 1, …, len = n i.e. for list data *d*, *degree(d) = len(d)*)
    
- Solve the **Little Cases** & identify **Base cases**

    Identifying the base cases, which are to be solved directly
    
    ---
    
    The case for which the solution can be stated non-recursively.
    
    ---
    
    As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision.
    
    ```python
    n! = n x (n−1)! 
    n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
    n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
    ⋅
    ⋅
    n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
    n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
    n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!
    ```
    
    ---
    
    we have the correct ordering, we need to look at the smallest elements in our ordering, and decide how we are going to handle them.
    
    ---
    
    Once we have solved our base cases, and we know our ordering, then solving the general case is as simple as reducing the problem in such a way that the degree of the data we’re operating on moves towards the base cases.
    
    find a [general case](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753.md)
    
- Solve the **Big Cases** - General (recursive) case
    
    Ensuring progress, that is the recursion converges to the solution.
    
    ---
    
    case for which the solution to a problem is expressed in terms of a smaller version of itself.
    
    ---
    
    ![Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/1_fdYWvfo0cwti98pP3pcEwA.gif](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/1_fdYWvfo0cwti98pP3pcEwA.gif)
    
    Here, we handle the data rightwards in our ordering, that is, data of high degree. 
    Usually, we consider data of arbitrary degree and aim to find a way to solve the problem by reducing it to an expression containing the same problem of lesser degree, e.g. in our Fibonacci example we started with arbitrary n and reduced fib(n) to fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) which is an expression containing two instances of the problem we started with, of lesser degree (n-1 and n-2, respectively).

    Phone Number Mnemonics:

    Almost every digit is associated with some letters in the alphabet; this allows certain phone numbers to spell out actual words.
    For example, the phone number 8464747328 can be written as timisgreat; similarly, the phone number 2686463 can be written as antoine or as ant6463.
    It's important to note that a phone number doesn't represent a single sequence of letters, but rather multiple combinations of letters.
    For instance, the digit 2 can represent three different letters (a, b, and c).
    A mnemonic is defined as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assist in remembering something
    Companies oftentimes use a mnemonic for their phone number to make it easier to remember.
    Given a stringified phone number of any non-zero length, write a function that returns all mnemonics for this phone number, in any order.
    For this problem, a valid mnemonic may only contain letters and the digits 0 and 1.
    In other words, if a digit is able to be represented by a letter, then it must be. Digits 0 and 1 are the only two digits that don't have letter representations on the keypad.
    Note that you should rely on the keypad illustrated above for digit-letter associations.

        s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
        t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
        |n - m| <= 1
    The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
    Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
        Output: true
    Example 2:
        Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
        Output: false
    Example 3:
        Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
        Output: true

    Sort Stack
    
    Write a function that takes in an array of integers representing a stack,
     recursively sorts the stack in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new array), and returns it.
    The array must be treated as a stack, with the end of the array as the top of the stack.
    Therefore, you're only allowed to:
        Pop elements from the top of the stack by removing elements from the end of the array using the built-in .pop() method in your programming language of choice.
        Push elements to the top of the stack by appending elements to the end of the array using the built-in .append() method in your programming language of choice.
        Peek at the element on top of the stack by accessing the last element in the array.
    You're not allowed to perform any other operations on the input array, 
     including accessing elements (except for the last element),
     moving elements, etc.. 
    You're also not allowed to use any other data structures, and your solution must be recursive.

- Regular Expression Matching
    
    ```python
    """ 
    Regular Expression Matching
    
    Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
        '.' Matches any single character.
        '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
        The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
    
     
    
    Example 1:
        Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
        Output: false
        Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
    Example 2:
        Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
        Output: true
        Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
    Example 3:
        Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
        Output: true
        Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
    Example 4:
        Input: s = "aab", p = "c*a*b"
        Output: true
        Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
    Example 5:
        Input: s = "mississippi", p = "mis*is*p*."
        Output: false

    Basic Regex Parser:
    
    Implement a regular expression function isMatch that supports the '.' and '*' symbols. 
    The function receives two strings - text and pattern - and should return true if the text matches the pattern as a regular expression. 
    For simplicity, assume that the actual symbols '.' and '*' do not appear in the text string and are used as special symbols only in the pattern string.
    In case you aren’t familiar with regular expressions, the function determines if the text and pattern are the equal, 
        where the '.' is treated as a single a character wildcard (see third example), 
        and '*' is matched for a zero or more sequence of the previous letter (see fourth and fifth examples).

## How do you determine if there is a recursive solution to a problem?

1. **Base case question** Is there a base case? Is there a way out of the function that does not require a recursive call and in which the function works correctly?
2. **Smaller caller question** Does each recursive call result in a smaller version of the original problem which leads inescapably to the base case.
3. **General case question** Assuming each recursive call works correctly, does this lead to the correct solution to the whole problem? The answer to this question can be shown through induction:
    1. Show that the solution works for the base case, i.e. SumOfSquares(n, n).
    2. Assume that the solution works for the case of SumOfSquares(n, n+1).
    3. Now to finish the proof show that the solution works for SumOfSquares(n, n+2):
        1. The return value from the first recursive call to the function would be n + SumOfSquares(n+1, n+2).
        2. This is just the results of a call to the base case SumOfSquares(n, n) which we have already shown to work, and a call to what is syntactically equivalent to SumOfSquares(n, n+1) which we have assumed works.
        3. Thus, by induction, we have shown that the function works for all values of **m** and **n** where **m < n**.

## **Ways of dividing a problem into subproblems:**

Recursive solutions, by definition, are built off of solutions to subproblems. Many times, this will mean simply to compute f(n) by adding something, removing something, or otherwise changing the solution for f(n-1). In other cases, you might solve the problem for the first half of the data set, then the second half, and then merge those results.

There are many ways you might divide a problem into subproblems. Three of the most common approaches to developing an algorithm are bottom-up, top-down, and half-and-half.

**Top-down** and **bottom-up** refer to two general approaches to dynamic programming. A top-down solution starts with the final result and recursively breaks it down into subproblems. The bottom-up method does the opposite. It takes an iterative approach to solve the subproblems first and then works up to the desired solution.

### 1. **Top-Down Approach**

The top-down approach can be more complex since it's less concrete. But sometimes, it's the best way to think about the problem. In these problems, we think about how we can **divide the problem for case N into subproblems**. Be careful of overlap between the cases.

**Top-down with [Memoization](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753.md):**

In this approach, we try to solve the bigger problem by recursively finding the solution to smaller sub-problems. Whenever we solve a sub-problem, we cache its result so that we don’t end up solving it repeatedly if it’s called multiple times. Instead, we can just return the saved result. This technique of storing the results of already solved subproblems is called **Memoization**.

### 2. **Bottom-Up Approach**

The bottom-up approach is often the most intuitive. We **start with knowing how to solve the problem for a simple case**, like a list with only one element. Then we figure out how to solve the problem for two elements, then for three elements, and so on. The key here is to think about how you can build the solution for one case off of the previous case (or multiple previous cases).

**Bottom-up with [Tabulation](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753.md):**

**Tabulation** is the opposite of the top-down approach and avoids recursion. In this approach, we solve the problem “bottom-up” (i.e. by **solving all the related sub-problems first**). This is typically done by filling up an n-dimensional table. Based on the results in the table, the solution to the top/original problem is then computed.

Tabulation is the **opposite of Memoization**, as in Memoization we solve the problem and maintain a map of already solved sub-problems. In other words, in memoization, we do it top-down in the sense that we solve the top problem first (which typically recurses down to solve the sub-problems).

Examples:

- Sort stack
    
    
    ```python
    """ 
    Sort Stack: (Under stacks)
    
    Write a function that takes in an array of integers representing a stack,
     recursively sorts the stack in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new array), and returns it.
    The array must be treated as a stack, with the end of the array as the top of the stack.
    Therefore, you're only allowed to:
        Pop elements from the top of the stack by removing elements from the end of the array using the built-in .pop() method in your programming language of choice.
        Push elements to the top of the stack by appending elements to the end of the array using the built-in .append() method in your programming language of choice.
        Peek at the element on top of the stack by accessing the last element in the array.
    You're not allowed to perform any other operations on the input array, 
     including accessing elements (except for the last element),
     moving elements, etc.. 
    You're also not allowed to use any other data structures, and your solution must be recursive.
    
    Sample Input
        stack = [-5, 2, -2, 4, 3, 1]
        Sample Output
        [-5, -2, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        
    https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Sort%20Stack
    """
    
    # O(n^2) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the stack
    # # this will work by looping through all the elements of the stack
    # # a bottom-up recursion approach where we start by sorting a stack of len 0, len 1, then 2, then 3
    # remove every element till we have an empty stack
    #   then insert them one by one at their correct position
    def sortStack(stack):
        # base case
        if len(stack) == 0:
            return stack
    
        # remove element at the top (element top),
        # sort the rest of the stack,
        # insert top back to the stack but at its correct position
        #   this will be work easily because the rest of the stack is sorted
        top = stack.pop()
        sortStack(stack)
        insertElementInCorrectPosition(stack, top)
        return stack
    
    # requires a sorted stack
    def insertElementInCorrectPosition(stack, num):
        # base cases
        # correct positions to insert num
        if len(stack) == 0 or stack[-1] <= num:
            stack.append(num)
    
        # remove the element at the top and try to insert num at a lower position
        #   return top once that is done
        else:
            top = stack.pop()
            insertElementInCorrectPosition(stack, num)
            stack.append(top)
    ```
    

### 3. **Half-and-Half Approach**

In addition to top-down and bottom-up approaches, it's often effective to **divide the data set in half**. For example, a binary search works with a "half-and-half" approach. When we look for an element in a sorted array, we first figure out which half of the array contains the value. Then we recurse and search for it in that half. Merge sort is also a "half-and-half" approach. We sort each half of the array and then merge together the sorted halves.

## **Maintaining State**

When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

- Thread (pass down) the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
- Keep the state in the global scope
    - eg: use [nonlocal](_Object-Oriented%20Analysis%20and%20Design%201a01887a9271475da7b3cd3f4efc9e0d.md)

---

Guides:

- Recursion is especially suitable when the input is expressed in recursive rules such as a computer grammar.
- Recursion is a good choice for **search**, **enumeration**, and **divide-and-conquer**.
- Use recursion as an alternative to deeply nested iteration loops. For example, recursion is much better when you have an undefined number of levels, such as the IP address problem generalized to k substrings.
- If you are asked to remove recursion from a program, consider mimicking call stack with the **stack** data structure.
- Recursion can be easily removed from a tail-recursive program by using a while-loop no stack is needed. (Optimizing compilers do this.)
- If a recursive function may end up being called with the **same arguments more than once**, **cache** the results-this is the idea behind **Dynamic Programming**

> A **divide-and-conquer** algorithm works by repeatedly decomposing a problem into two or more smaller independent subproblems of the same kind until it gets to instances that are simple enough to be solved directly.

### More explanation

A useful mantra to adopt when solving problems recursively is *‘fake it ’til you make it’*, that is, **pretend you’ve already solved the problem for a simpler case**, and then try to reduce the larger problem to use the solution for this simpler case. If a problem is suited to recursion, there should actually only be a small number of simple cases which you need to explicitly solve, i.e. this method of reducing to a simpler problem can be used to solve every other case.

![Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/1_cxQUnD3J3jMDIQTpsB7PNQ.gif](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/1_cxQUnD3J3jMDIQTpsB7PNQ.gif)

Suppose we are given some actual data of some data type, call it `dₒ`. The idea with recursion is to pretend that we have already solved the problem or computed the desired function `f` for all forms of this data type that are simpler than `dₒ` according to some degree of difficulty that we need to define. Then, if we can find a way of expressing `f(dₒ)` in terms of one or more `f(d)`s, where all of these d s are less difficult (have a smaller degree) than `dₒ`, then we have found a way to reduce and solve for `f(dₒ)`. We repeat this process, and hopefully, at some point, the remaining `f(d)`s will get so simple that we can easily implement a **fixed, closed solution** to them. Then, our solution to the original problem will reveal itself as our solutions to progressively simpler problems aggregate and **cascade back up to the top**.

# Honourable mentions

- Use indexes to eliminate elements in an array instead of creating a new array all the time in recursion
    
    Creating new array:
    
    ```python
    def getPermutationsHelper(res, curr_perm, array):
        if len(array) == 0:
            if len(curr_perm) > 0:
                res.append(curr_perm)
            return
    
        for i in range(len(array)):
            # add the number(array[i]), add it to the permutation and remove it from the array
            new_array = array[:i] + array[i+1:]  # remove number form array
            new_perm = curr_perm + [array[i]]  # add number to the permutation
    
            getPermutationsHelper(res, new_perm, new_array)
    
    def getPermutations(array):
        res = []
        getPermutationsHelper(res, [], array)
        return res
    ```
    
    Using indexes:
    
    ```python
    def swap(array, a, b):
        array[a], array[b] = array[b], array[a]
    
    def getPermutationsHelper(res, curr_perm, array, pos):
        if pos >= len(array):
            if len(curr_perm) > 0:
                res.append(curr_perm)
            return
    
        for i in range(pos, len(array)):
            # add the number(array[i]) to the permutation
            # place the element of interest at the first position (pos)
            #  Example: for getPermutationsHelper(res, [], [1,2,3], 0), while in this for loop
            #       when at value 1 (i=0), we want 1 to be at pos(0), so that we can iterate through [2,3,4] next without adding 1 again
            #       when at 2, we want 2 to be at pos(0), so that we can iterate through [1,3,4] next ([2,1,3,4])
            #       when at 3, we want it to be at pos(0), so that we can iterate through [2,1,4] next ([3,2,1,4])
            #   so we have to manually place it there (via swapping with the element at pos), then we return it just before the loop ends
            # and move pos forward
    
            new_perm = curr_perm + [array[i]]  # add number to the permutation
    
            # place the element of interest at the first position (pos)
            swap(array, pos, i)
            getPermutationsHelper(res, new_perm, array, pos+1)
            # return the element of interest to its original position
            swap(array, i, pos)
    
    def getPermutations(array):
        res = []
        getPermutationsHelper(res, [], array, 0)

            res.append(array[:])
            return

        Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.
        
        Example 1:
            Input: k = 3, n = 7
            Output: [[1,2,4]]
            Explanation:
                1 + 2 + 4 = 7
                There are no other valid combinations.
        Example 2:
            Input: k = 3, n = 9
            Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
            Explanation:
                1 + 2 + 6 = 9
                1 + 3 + 5 = 9
                2 + 3 + 4 = 9
                There are no other valid combinations.
        Example 3:
            Input: k = 4, n = 1
            Output: []
            Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
                Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], 
                the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.
        Example 4:
            Input: k = 3, n = 2
            Output: []
            Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
        Example 5:
            Input: k = 9, n = 45
            Output: [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]]
            Explanation:
                1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
                There are no other valid combinations.

        Combination Sum
        
        Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, 
            return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. 
        You may return the combinations in any order.
        The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. 
        Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
        It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
        
         
        Example 1:
            Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
            Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
            Explanation:
                2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
                7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
                These are the only two combinations.

[Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns)

Dynamic programming is basically, recursion plus using common sense. The intuition behind dynamic programming is that we trade space for time, i.e. to say that instead of calculating all the states taking a lot of time but no space, we take up space to store the results of all the sub-problems to save time later.

---

One can also think of dynamic programming as a table-filling algorithm: **you know the calculations you have to do, so you pick the best order to do them in and ignore the ones you don't have to fill in**.

---

DP is an optimisation technique → [can reduce exponential to polynomial time](https://youtu.be/0Tu-GRM_lE0?t=148)

---

Common problems:

1. **Combinatory:** Answer question... **how many?**
2. **Optimisation:** maximises or minimises some function Examples: what is the **minimum/maximum?**

---

***Dynamic programming*** is mostly just a matter of taking a recursive algorithm and **finding the overlapping subproblems** (that is, the repeated calls). You then **cache** those results for future recursive calls. Alternatively, you can study the pattern of the recursive calls and implement something iterative. You still "cache" previous work

Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem into simpler sub-problems and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem is only solved once. One of the simplest examples of dynamic programming is computing the nth Fibonacci number. A good way to approach such a problem is often to implement it as a normal recursive solution, and then add the caching part.

Every Dynamic Programming problem has a schema to be followed:

- Show that the problem can be broken down into optimal sub-problems.
- Recursively define the value of the solution by expressing it in terms of optimal solutions for smaller sub-problems.
- Compute the value of the optimal solution in a bottom-up fashion.
- Construct an optimal solution from the computed information.

The majority of the Dynamic Programming problems can be categorized into two types:

1. **Optimization problems** The optimization problems expect you to select a feasible solution so that the value of the required function is minimized or maximized.
2. **Combinatorial problems** expect you to figure out the number of ways to do something, or the probability of some event happening.

    Coin Change 2/Total Unique Ways To Make Change:
    
    You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
    Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
    The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:

        5=2+2+1
        5=2+1+1+1
        5=1+1+1+1+1
    Example 2:
        Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
        Output: 0

    Longest Common Subsequence
    
    Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. 
    If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
    A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none)
        deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
    A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

    Staircase Traversal:
    You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time.
    Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.
    
    For example, if you were given a staircase of height = 3 and maxSteps = 2 you could climb the staircase in 3 ways.
    You could take 1 step, 1 step, then 1 step, you could also take 1 step, then 2 steps, and you could take 2 steps, then 1 step.

    Decode Ways
    
    A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
        'A' -> "1"
        'B' -> "2"
        ...
        'Z' -> "26"
    To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
        "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
        "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
        Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".
    Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.
    The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: s = "12"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
    Example 2:
        Input: s = "226"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
    Example 3:
        Input: s = "0"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.
            The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.
            Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.
    Example 4:
        Input: s = "06"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
     
    
    Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 100
        s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

    Interleaving String/Interweaving Strings:
    
    Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.
    An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:
        s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
        t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
        |n - m| <= 1
    The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
    Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
        Output: true
    Example 2:

    Unique Paths:
    
    A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
    The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 
    The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
    How many possible unique paths are there?
    
    Example 1:

        Output: 28
    Example 2:
        Input: m = 3, n = 2
        Output: 3
        Explanation:
        From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
        1. Right -> Down -> Down
        2. Down -> Down -> Right
        3. Down -> Right -> Down
    Example 3:

    Example
    	99*2 => 99
    
    Number Of Ways To Traverse Graph:
    You're given two positive integers representing the width and height of a grid-shaped, rectangular graph.
    Write a function that returns the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the graph when starting at the top left corner.
    Each move you take must either go down or right. In other words, you can never move up or left in the graph.
    For example, given the graph illustrated below, with width = 2 and height = 3, 
        there are three ways to reach the bottom right corner when starting at the top left corner:
            _ _
            |_|_|
            |_|_|
            |_|_|
            Down, Down, Right
            Right, Down, Down
            Down, Right, Down
    Note: you may assume that width * height >= 2.
    In other words, the graph will never be a 1x1 grid.
        Sample Input
        width = 4
        height = 3
        Sample Output

## **Characteristics of Dynamic Programming:**

Before moving on to understand different methods of solving a DP problem, let’s first take a look at what are the characteristics of a problem that tells us that we can apply DP to solve it.

### **1. Optimal Substructure Property**

[02 - What is DP? (Dynamic Programming for Beginners)](https://youtu.be/0Tu-GRM_lE0?t=302)

Optimal substructure requires that you can **solve a problem based on the solutions of subproblems.** Any problem has optimal substructure property if its overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems. For Fibonacci numbers, as we know,`Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)`. This clearly shows that a problem of size ‘n’ has been reduced to subproblems of size ‘n-1’ and ‘n-2’. Therefore, Fibonacci numbers have optimal substructure property.

A useful way to think about optimal substructure is **whether a problem can be easily solved recursively**. Recursive solutions inherently solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. If you can solve a problem recursively, it most likely has an optimal substructure.

### **2. Overlapping Subproblems**

[02 - What is DP? (Dynamic Programming for Beginners)](https://youtu.be/0Tu-GRM_lE0?t=492)

Sub-problems are smaller versions of the original problem. In fact, sub-problems often look like a reworded version of the original problem. If formulated correctly, sub-problems build on each other in order to obtain the solution to the original problem. Any problem has overlapping sub-problems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblem multiple times. 

![Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/Screenshot_2021-07-24_at_18.39.16.png](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/Screenshot_2021-07-24_at_18.39.16.png)

Take the example of the Fibonacci numbers; to find the `fib(4)`, we need to break it down into the following sub-problems: fib(4)fib(3)fib(2)fib(2)fib(1)fib(1)fib(0)fib(0)fib(1)

We can clearly see the overlapping subproblem pattern here, as `fib(2)` has been evaluated twice and `fib(1)` has been evaluated three times.

---

Later we'll learn that: Whenever we solve a sub-problem, we [cache its result](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753.md) so that we don’t end up solving it repeatedly if it’s called multiple times. Instead, we can just return the saved result. This technique of storing the results of already solved subproblems is called Memoization.

---

## Dynamic Programming Methods

***Memoization*** is the technique of writing a function that remembers the results of previous computations. Memoization ensures that a function doesn't run for the same inputs more than once by keeping a record of the results for the given inputs (usually in a dictionary).

***Bottom-Up Algorithms***: Going **bottom-up** is a way to avoid recursion, saving the **memory cost** that recursion incurs when it builds up the **call stack**. Put simply, a bottom-up algorithm "starts from the beginning," while a recursive algorithm often "starts from the end and works backwards."

### 1. Top-down with Memoization

In this approach, we try to solve the bigger problem by recursively finding the solution to smaller sub-problems. Whenever we solve a sub-problem, we cache its result so that we don’t end up solving it repeatedly if it’s called multiple times. Instead, we can just return the saved result. This technique of storing the results of already solved subproblems is called **Memoization**.

Fibonacci - This problem is normally solved with [Divide and Conquer](https://www.notion.so/Divide-and-Conquer-ac78d33c576042c78e15b1587684c04e) algorithm. There are **3** main parts in this technique:

1. **Divide:** divide the problem into smaller *sub-problems* of same type
2. **Conquer:** solve the sub-problems *recursively*
3. **Combine:** combine all the sub-problems *to create a solution to the original problem*

[Example](_Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions%20e3f5361611c147ebb2fb3eff37a743fd/DP%20f1cdccd481ba461ea65ea993e984da07/0%201%20Knapsack%20(Dynamic%20Programming)%20b70111b897a547b6afdc2fc5cec2fbb6.md)

![Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/Untitled.png](Recursion,%20DP%20&%20Backtracking%20525dddcdd0874ed98372518724fc8753/Untitled.png)

```python
def calculateFibonacci(n):
  memoize = [-1 for x in range(n+1)]
  return calculateFibonacciRecur(memoize, n)

def calculateFibonacciRecur(memoize, n):
  if n < 2:
    return n
  if memoize[n] >= 0:   # if we have already solved this subproblem, simply return the result from the cache
    return memoize[n]

  memoize[n] = calculateFibonacciRecur(memoize, n - 1) + calculateFibonacciRecur(memoize, n - 2)
  return memoize[n]
```

### 2. Bottom-up with Tabulation

Tabulation is the opposite of the top-down approach and avoids recursion. In this approach, we solve the problem “bottom-up” (i.e. by solving all the related sub-problems first). This is typically done by filling up an n-dimensional table. Based on the results in the table, the solution to the top/original problem is then computed.

[Example](_Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions%20e3f5361611c147ebb2fb3eff37a743fd/DP%20f1cdccd481ba461ea65ea993e984da07/0%201%20Knapsack%20(Dynamic%20Programming)%20b70111b897a547b6afdc2fc5cec2fbb6.md)

```python
def calculateFibonacci(n):
  dp = [0, 1]
  for i in range(2, n + 1):
    dp.append(dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])

  return dp[n]
```

One can also think of dynamic programming as a table-filling algorithm: **you know the calculations you have to do, so you pick the best order to do them in and ignore the ones you don't have to fill in**.

## **The FAST method**

The most successful interviewees are those who have developed a repeatable strategy to succeed. This is especially true for dynamic programming. This is the reason for the development of the FAST method.

There are four steps in the FAST method:

1. **F**irst solution
2. **A**nalyze the first solution
3. Identify the **S**ubproblems
4. **T**urn the solution around

### 1. **First solution**

This is an important step for any interview question but is particularly important for dynamic programming. 

This step finds the first possible solution. This solution will be **brute force and recursive**. The goal is to solve the problem **without concern for efficiency**.

It means that if you need to find the biggest/smallest/longest/shortest something, you should write code
that goes **through every possibility** and then compares them all
to find the best one.

Your solution must also meet these restrictions:

- The recursive calls must be self-contained. That means
**no global variables.**
- You cannot do tail recursion. Your solution must compute
the results to each subproblem and then combine them
afterwards.
- **Do not pass in unnecessary variables**. Eg. If you can
count the depth of your recursion **as you return**, don’t
pass a count variable into your recursive function.
    
    Once you’ve gone through a couple problems, you will likely see
    how this solution looks almost the same every time.
    

### 2. **Analyze the first solution**

In this step, we will analyze the first solution that you came upwith. This involves determining the time and space complexity of your first solution and asking whether there is obvious room for improvement.

As part of the analytical process, we need to ask whether the first solution fits our rules for problems with dynamic solutions:

- Does it have an **optimal substructure**? Since our solution’s recursive, then there is a strong likelihood that it meets this criteria. If we are recursively solving subproblems of the same problem, then we know that our substructure is optimal, otherwise our algorithm wouldn’t work.
- Are there **overlapping subproblems?** This can be more difficult to determine because it doesn’t always present itself with small examples. It may be necessary to try a **medium-sized test case**. This will enable you to see if you end up calling the same function with the same input multiple times.

### 3. **Find the Subproblems**

If our solution can be made dynamic, the exact subproblems to memoize must be codified. This step requires us to discover the high-level meaning of the subproblems. This will make it easier to understand the solution later. Our recursive solution can be made dynamic by caching the values. This top-down solution facilitates a better understanding of the subproblems which is useful for the next step.

### 4. **Turn the solution around**

We now have a top-down solution. This is fine and it would be possible to stop here. However, sometimes it is better to flip it around and to get a bottom-up solution instead. Since we understand our subproblems, we will do that. This involves writing a completely different function (without modifying the existing code). This will iteratively compute the results of successive subproblems until our desired result is reached.

---

In recursion for example for Fibonacci calculation, if the root node (in the recursion tree) has two children. Each of those children has two children (so four children total in the "grand­ children" level). Each of those grandchildren has two children, and so on. If we do this n times, we'll have roughlyO(2") nodes. This gives us a runtime of roughly 0(2").

[Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is an algorithmic technique that involves trying possibilities along a "search path" and cutting off paths of search that will no longer yield a solution.
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

💡 How to identify Backtracking:
It is a general dfs algorithm for **finding all (or some) solutions to some problems with constraints**.

</aside>

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that considers searching in every possible combination for solving a computational problem.

It is known for solving problems recursively one step at a time and removing those solutions that do not satisfy the problem constraints at any point in time.
It is a **refined brute force** approach that tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the best possible ones out of them.

    Combination Sum
    
    Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, 
        return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. 
    You may return the combinations in any order.
    The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. 
    Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
    It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
    
     
    Example 1:
        Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
        Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
        Explanation:
            2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
            7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
            These are the only two combinations.
    Example 2:
        Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
        Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
    Example 3:
        Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
        Output: []
    Example 4:
        Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
        Output: [[1]]
    Example 5:
        Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
        Output: [[1,1]]

        The execution of the backtracking is unfolded as a DFS traversal in a n-ary tree. The total number of steps during the backtracking would be the number of nodes in the tree.
        At each node, it takes a constant time to process, except the leaf nodes which could take a linear time to make a copy of combination. So we can say that the time complexity is linear to the number of nodes of the execution tree.
        Here we provide a loose upper bound on the number of nodes:
            First of all, the fan-out of each node would be bounded to N, i.e. the total number of candidates.
            The maximal depth of the tree, would be T/M, where we keep on adding the smallest element to the combination.
            As we know, the maximal number of nodes in N-ary tree of T/M, height would be : O(N ^ (T/M + 1))
        Note that, the actual number of nodes in the execution tree would be much smaller than the upper bound, since the fan-out of the nodes are decreasing level by level.

    O(N.N!) time | O(N) space:
    - The idea is that for each recursive call, we will iterate over N elements and make another recursive call. 
        Assume we picked one element, then we iterate over the array and make recursive calls for the next N-1 elements and so on.
        Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, 
            the total number of recursive calls will be N⋅(N−1)⋅(N−2)⋅...⋅2⋅1=N! and in each recursive call we perform an O(N) time operation.
    - Another way is to visualize all possible states by drawing a recursion tree. 
        From root node we have NN recursive calls. The first level, therefore, has N nodes. 
        For each of the nodes in the first level, we have (N-1) similar choices. 
        As a result, the second level has N∗(N−1) nodes, and so on. The last level must have N⋅(N−1)⋅(N−2)⋅(N−3)⋅...⋅2⋅1 nodes.
    
    - make a subset with sum totalArraySum/k
        - reduce the needed(k) by one
        - start again with other numbers
    -repeat the above till the needed substets == 0

### **These "search paths" can manifest as:**

- Actual **search paths** in a graph or searchable structure
- **Chosen** characters placed in a progress string
- **Moves played** in a puzzle, etc.

### **The 3 core ideas behind backtracking are:**

- **The Choice**: What fundamental choice is being made at every step of the algorithm to advance to a solution?
- **The Constraints**: When is a path of decision no longer fruitful? When does the algorithm know for sure that it is wasting time following a certain path? If it is determined a path will no longer yield a solution an algorithm is said to "**backtrack**" when it returns control to a previous decision that can be advanced from.
- **The Goal**: When do we know that the solution has been found?

Backtracking algorithms are most naturally modeled recursively, though **not all recursion is backtracking** as backtracking is characterized by the actual act of **backtracking** when a path is no longer solvable. There must be an element of reflecting on the algorithm's state and deciding to backtrack.
