Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out).

Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack:

- `.push()`**:** Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- `.pop()`**:** Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- `.peek()`**:** Returns top element of stack.
- `**.is_empty()`:** Returns true if stack is empty, else false.

Often implemented as a linked list to give the above operations a time complexity of O(1)

> The last-in, first-out semantics of a stack makes it very useful for creating **reverse iterators** for sequences that are **stored in a way that would make it difficult or impossible to step back from a given element**.
> 

Some of the problems require you to implement your own stack class; for others, use the built-in list-type.

- s.append(e) pushes an element onto the stack. Not much can go wrong with a call to push.
- s[-1] will retrieve but does not remove, the element at the top of the stack.
- s.pop(0) will remove and return the element at the top of the stack.
- len(s) == 0 tests if the stack is empty.

    Min Max Stack Construction:
    
    Write a MinMaxStack class for a Min Max Stack. The class should support:
    Pushing and popping values on and off the stack.
    Peeking at the value at the top of the stack.
    Getting both the minimum and the maximum values in the stack at any given point in time.
    All class methods, when considered independently, should run in constant time and with constant space.
    
    Sample Usage:
        // All operations below are performed sequentially.
        MinMaxStack(): - // instantiate a MinMaxStack
        push(5): -
        getMin(): 5

- Next Greater Element II  *
    
    ```python
    """
    Next Greater Element II 
    Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), 
        return the next greater number for every element in nums.
    The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, 
        which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,2,1]
        Output: [2,-1,2]
        Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
            The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
            The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
        Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]

    """
    
    """
    Next Greater Element:
    
    Write a function that takes in an array of integers
     and returns a new array containing,at each index,
     the next element in the input array that's greater than the element at that index in the input array.
    In other words, your function should return a new array
     where outputArray[i] is the next element in the input array that's greater than inputArray[i].
    If there's no such next greater element for a particular index,
     the value at that index in the output array should be -1.
    
    For example, given array = [1, 2], your function should return [2, -1].
    Additionally, your function should treat the input array as a circular array.
     A circular array wraps around itself as if it were connected end-to-end.
     So the next index after the last index in a circular array is the first index.
     This means that, for our problem, given array = [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0 0],
      the next greater element after 3 is 5, since the array is circular.

- Simplify Path/Shorten Path
    
    ```python
    """ 
    Simplify Path/Shorten Path:
    
    Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system,
     convert it to the simplified canonical path.
    In a Unix-style file system, 
        a period '.' refers to the current directory, 
        a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, 
        and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. 
        For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.
    The canonical path should have the following format:
        The path starts with a single slash '/'.
        Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
        The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
        The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
    Return the simplified canonical path.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: path = "/home/"
        Output: "/home"
        Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
    Example 2:
        Input: path = "/../"
        Output: "/"
        Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
    Example 3:
        Input: path = "/home//foo/"
        Output: "/home/foo"
        Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
    Example 4:
        Input: path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
        Output: "/c"

- Exclusive Time of Functions

    ```python
    """ 
    Exclusive Time of Functions:
    
    On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. 
    Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
    Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. 
    The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. 
    Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
    You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string "{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}". 
    For example, "0:start:3" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and "1:end:2" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. 
    Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
    A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. 
    For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
    Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.

    Explanation:
    Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
    Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
    Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
    Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
    Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
    So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

- Next Greater Element II  *
    
    ```python
    """
    Next Greater Element II 
    Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), 
        return the next greater number for every element in nums.
    The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, 
        which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,2,1]
        Output: [2,-1,2]
        Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
            The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
            The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
        Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]

    """
    Next Greater Element:
    
    Write a function that takes in an array of integers
     and returns a new array containing,at each index,
     the next element in the input array that's greater than the element at that index in the input array.
    In other words, your function should return a new array
     where outputArray[i] is the next element in the input array that's greater than inputArray[i].
    If there's no such next greater element for a particular index,
     the value at that index in the output array should be -1.
    
    For example, given array = [1, 2], your function should return [2, -1].
    Additionally, your function should treat the input array as a circular array.
     A circular array wraps around itself as if it were connected end-to-end.
     So the next index after the last index in a circular array is the first index.
     This means that, for our problem, given array = [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0 0],
      the next greater element after 3 is 5, since the array is circular.

# Queues

To implement a queue, we again need two basic operations: `enqueue()` and `dequeue()`

`enqueue()` operation appends an element to the end of the queue and `dequeue()` operation removes an element from the beginning of the queue.

- Asteroid Collision
    
    ```python
    """ 
    735. Asteroid Collision
    
    We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.
    For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). 
    Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
    Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. 
    If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
    
     
    
    Example 1:
        Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
        Output: [5,10]
        Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
    Example 2:
        Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
        Output: []
        Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
    Example 3:
        Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
        Output: [10]
        Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
    Example 4:
        Input: asteroids = [-2,-1,1,2]
        Output: [-2,-1,1,2]
        Explanation: The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right. Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.

        void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
        int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
        int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.

    Notes:
    You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
    Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. 
    You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
    Follow-up: 
    Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity?

    ```python
    """ 
    622. Design Circular Queue:
    
    Design your implementation of the circular queue. 
    The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle 
        and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. 
    It is also called "Ring Buffer".
    
    One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. 
    In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. 
    But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.
    
    Implementation the MyCircularQueue class:
        MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
        int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
        int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
        boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
        boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
        boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.

# `collections.deque()`

[How to use a deque in Python](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-use-a-deque-in-python)

Can be used as both a stack and a queue:

- Stack: `pop()`
- Queue: `popleft()`

Here’s a summary of the main characteristics of `deque`:

- Stores items of any [data type](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)
- Is a [mutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mutable) data type
- Supports [membership operations](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/#the-in-operator) with the `in` operator
- Supports [indexing](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/#list-elements-can-be-accessed-by-index), like in `a_deque[i]`
- Doesn’t support slicing, like in `a_deque[0:2]`
- Supports built-in functions that operate on sequences and iterables, such as `[len()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len)`, `[sorted()](https://realpython.com/python-sort/)`, `[reversed()](https://realpython.com/python-reverse-list/)`, and more
- Doesn’t support [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) sorting
- Supports normal and reverse iteration
- Supports pickling with `[pickle](https://realpython.com/python-pickle-module/)`
- Ensures fast, memory-efficient, and thread-safe pop and append operations on both ends

Creating `deque` instances is a straightforward process. You just need to import `deque` from `collections` and call it with an optional `iterable` as an argument:

```python
>>> from collections import deque

>>> # Create an empty deque
>>> deque()
deque([])

>>> # Use different iterables to create deques
>>> deque((1, 2, 3, 4))
deque([1, 2, 3, 4])

>>> deque([1, 2, 3, 4])
deque([1, 2, 3, 4])

>>> deque(range(1, 5))
deque([1, 2, 3, 4])

>>> deque("abcd")
deque(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])

>>> numbers = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
>>> deque(numbers.keys())
deque(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'])

>>> deque(numbers.values())
deque([1, 2, 3, 4])

>>> deque(numbers.items())
deque([('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3), ('four', 4)])
```

```python
import collections

# Create a deque
DoubleEnded = collections.deque(["Mon","Tue","Wed"])
print(DoubleEnded)

# Append to the right
print("Adding to the right: ")
DoubleEnded.append("Thu")
print(DoubleEnded)

# append to the left
print("Adding to the left: ")
DoubleEnded.appendleft("Sun")
print(DoubleEnded)

# Remove from the right
print("Removing from the right: ")
DoubleEnded.pop()
print(DoubleEnded)

# Remove from the left
print("Removing from the left: ")
DoubleEnded.popleft()
print(DoubleEnded)

# Reverse the dequeue
print("Reversing the deque: ")
DoubleEnded.reverse()
print(DoubleEnded)

""" 
deque(['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed'])

Adding to the right: 
deque(['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu'])

Adding to the left: 
deque(['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu'])

Removing from the right: 
deque(['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed'])

Removing from the left: 
deque(['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed'])

Reversing the deque: 
deque(['Wed', 'Tue', 'Mon'])
"""
```

If you instantiate `deque` without providing an `iterable` as an argument, then you get an empty deque. If you
