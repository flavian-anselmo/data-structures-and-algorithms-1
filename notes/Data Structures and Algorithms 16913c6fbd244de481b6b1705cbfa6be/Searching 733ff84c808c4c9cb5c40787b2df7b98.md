# Linear/Sequential Search

# Binary Search

[Binary-search Interview Questions - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/313216/Binary-search-Interview-Questions)

[]()

Requires a **sorted array**.

The terminology used in Binary Search:

- Target - the value that you are searching for
- Index - the current location that you are searching
- Left, Right - the indices from which we use to maintain our search Space
- Mid - the index that we use to apply a condition to determine if we should search left or right

![Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98/binary_search.gif](Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98/binary_search.gif)

### How does it work?

In its simplest form, Binary Search operates on a contiguous sequence with a specified left and right index. This is called the **Search Space**. Binary Search maintains the left, right, and middle indices of the search space and **compares the search target or applies the search condition to the middle value** of the collection; if the condition is unsatisfied or values unequal, **the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated** and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with an empty half, the condition cannot be fulfilled and the target is not found.

<aside>
ð¡ Binary Search can take many alternate forms and might not always be as straightforward as searching for a specific value. Sometimes you will have to apply a specific condition or rule to determine which side (left or right) to search next.

</aside>

## Common types of Binary Search

### Simple Binary Search

This is the most basic and elementary form of Binary Search. It is the standard Binary Search Template that most high schools or universities use when they first teach students computer science. It is used to search for an element or condition which can be determined by **accessing a single index in the array**.

**Basic logic:**

```python
# Binary Search
# -1 means not found

def search(self, nums, target):
    if not nums:
        return -1
    if len(nums) == 1 and nums[0] == target:
        return 0
            
    
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    # not while left < right: because of cases where the target is on the right pointer
    # like ([1,2,5], 5)
    # the mid can be on the left pointer but never on the right pointer because of the,
    # the floor division -> rounds down results
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left+right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # # check which half is invalid. Note that mid is already invalid
        # left is invalid (all the numbers to the left are smaller than target)
        elif target > nums[mid]:
            # move left pointer
            # skip mid & all the numbers to the left of it
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # skip mid & all the numbers to the right of it
            right = mid - 1
            
    
    return -1
```

**Key attributes:**

- Search condition can be determined **without comparing to the element's neighbours**
- **No post-processing** is required because at each step, you are checking to see if the element has been found. If you reach the end, then you know the element is not found
- We allow the right & left pointer be on the same index

**Distinguishing Syntax:**

- **Termination**: `left > right`
The while loop looks similar to `while left <= right:`
- **Searching Left:** `right = mid-1`
- Searching Right: `left = mid+1`
- Initial Condition: `left = 0, right = length-1`

    You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:
        -1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
        1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
        0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).

    Root of Number:
    
    Many times, we need to re-implement basic functions without using any standard library functions already implemented. 
    For example, when designing a chip that requires very little memory space.
    In this question weâll implement a function root that calculates the nâth root of a number. 
    The function takes a nonnegative number x and a positive integer n, 
    and returns the positive nâth root of x within an error of 0.001 (i.e. suppose the real root is y, then the error is: |y-root(x,n)| and must satisfy |y-root(x,n)| < 0.001).
    Donât be intimidated by the question. While there are many algorithms to calculate roots that require prior knowledge in numerical analysis, 
    there is also an elementary method which doesnât require more than guessing-and-checking. Try to think more in terms of the latter.
    Make sure your algorithm is efficient, and analyze its time and space complexities.

    Divide Two Integers:
    
    Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
    Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
    The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, truncate(8.345) = 8 and truncate(-2.7335) = -2.
    Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [â231, 231 â 1]. For this problem, assume that your function returns 231 â 1 when the division result overflows.
    
     
    
    Example 1:
        Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 10/3 = truncate(3.33333..) = 3.
    Example 2:
        Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
        Output: -2
        Explanation: 7/-3 = truncate(-2.33333..) = -2.
    Example 3:
        Input: dividend = 0, divisor = 1
        Output: 0
    Example 4:
        Input: dividend = 1, divisor = 1

- Random Pick with Weight *
    
    ```python
    """ 
    Random Pick with Weight: 
    (answers are so random)
    
    You are given an array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of ith index (0-indexed).
    We need to call the function pickIndex() which randomly returns an integer in the range [0, w.length - 1]. 
    pickIndex() should return the integer proportional to its weight in the w array. 
    For example, for w = [1, 3], the probability of picking the index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e 75%).
    More formally, the probability of picking index i is w[i] / sum(w).
    
    Example 1:
        Input
            ["Solution","pickIndex"]
            [[[1]],[]]
        Output
            [null,0]
        Explanation
            Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
            solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.
    
    Example 2:
    Input
        ["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
        [[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
    Output
        [null,1,1,1,1,0]
    Explanation
        Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
        solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.
        solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
        solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
        solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
        solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.
    
        Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
        [null,1,1,1,1,0]
        [null,1,1,1,1,1]
        [null,1,1,1,0,0]

### Advanced Binary Search I

This is an advanced form of binary search that is used to search for an element or condition which **requires accessing the current index & its *right neighbour's* index**.

![Untitled](Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98/Untitled.png)

Basic logic:

check out the [examples](Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98.md)

```python
def search(self, nums, target):
    
    if not nums or len(nums) < 1:
        return -1
    
    left, right = 0, len(nums) -1 
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left+right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif target > nums[mid]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
            
    # because of left < right : the middle pointer will never be at the right pointer, 
    # so if the the target is at the end of the array, 
    # the right pointer will never be checked (right = nums[-1]) and, hence never find the target
    # example: search([1,2,3], 3) -> will return -1
    if left < len(nums) and nums[left] == target:
        return left
            
    return -1
```

**Key Attributes:**

- Most of the time Post-processing required. Loop/Recursion ends when you have 1 element left. Need to assess if the remaining element meets the condition.
This is because the `while left < right` instead of `while left <= right` *
If the target is at the right index, it won't have been found in the initial search(while loop).
- Search Condition needs to access the element's immediate right/left neighbour
- Use the element's right/left neighbour to determine if the condition is met and decide whether to go left or right
- Guarantees Search Space is at least 2 in size at each step
- An advanced way to implement Binary Search.

**Distinguishing Syntax:**

- Initial Condition: `left = 0, right = length`
- Termination: `left == right`
- Searching Left: `right = mid`
- Searching Right: `left = mid+1`

    Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array:
    
    Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
    Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
    Given the sorted rotated array nums, return the minimum element of this array.

    Search in Rotated Sorted Array:
    
    There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
    Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) 
        such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).

    Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# BFS + DFS == 25% of the problems

Articles:

- [Leetcode Pattern 1 | BFS + DFS == 25% of the problems â part 1](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-1-bfs-dfs-25-of-the-problems-part-1-519450a84353) â DFS

Most graph, tree and string problems simply boil down to a DFS (Depth-first search) / BFS (Breadth-first search)

<aside>
ð¡ Always remember : 

    `stack` for DFS, imagine a vertical flow
    `queue` for BFS, horizontal flow

</aside>

<aside>
ð¡ Tree traversals:

Preorder â **n**lr (root, left, right)
Inorder â n**l**r (left, root, right): can use stack
Postorder â nl**r
l**evel order traversal: can be done using queue

</aside>

Have you ever wondered why we donât use a queue for dfs or stack for bfs?
questions like these really give us some insights into the difference
between stacks and queues.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/3072/1*evWtdhUMmRDU1blercHv4g.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/3072/1*evWtdhUMmRDU1blercHv4g.jpeg)

So using a stack I could pop 2 and push its kids and keep doing so eventually exhausting 2âs subtrees, 3 stays calmly in the stack just below the part where the real push-pop action is going, we pop 3 when all subtrees of 2 are done. This feature of the stack is essential for DFS.

While in a queue, I could dequeue 2 and enqueue its subtrees which go behind 3 as it was already sitting in the queue. So the next time I dequeue I get 3 and only after that do I move on to visiting 2âs subtrees, this is essentially a BFS!

For me this revelation was pure bliss. Take a moment to celebrate the history of Computer Science and the geniuses behind these simple yet powerful ideas.

### Time Complexity

# DFS:

[Coding Patterns: Depth First Search (DFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/depth-first-search/)

DFS â diving as deep as possible before coming back to take a dive again: can use stack

<aside>
ð¡ DFS is suitable for **game or puzzle problems**. We make a decision, then explore all paths through this decision. And if this decision leads to a winning situation, we stop.

</aside>

### Examples:

- Course Schedule/Tasks Scheduling

- Alien Dictionary

## Basic DFS (use stack)

With recursion

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.children = []
        self.name = name

    def depthFirstSearch(self, array):
        self._depthFirstSearchHelper(array)
        return array

    def _depthFirstSearchHelper(self, array):
        array.append(self.name)
        
        for child in self.children:
            child._depthFirstSearchHelper(array)
```

With stack

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.children = []
        self.name = name

    def depthFirstSearch(self, array):
        stack = [self]

        while len(stack) > 0:
            curr = stack.pop()
            array.append(curr.name)
            for idx in reversed(range(len(curr.children))):
                stack.append(curr.children[idx])

        return array
```

# BFS:

[Coding Patterns: Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/breadth-first-search/)

[Breadth First Search Algorithm | Shortest Path | Graph Theory](https://youtu.be/oDqjPvD54Ss)

![Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98/Screenshot_2021-07-18_at_06.28.43.png](Searching%20733ff84c808c4c9cb5c40787b2df7b98/Screenshot_2021-07-18_at_06.28.43.png)

These are basically level order traversals.

BFS can be used to find a single-source shortest path in an unweighted graph because, in BFS, we reach a vertex with a minimum number of edges from a source vertex.

<aside>
ð¡ All shortest path problems use BFS

</aside>

**Thoughts on BFS:**

1. Problems in which you have to find the **shortest path** are most likely calling for a BFS.
2. For graphs having **unit edge distances**, **shortest paths** from any point is just a BFS starting at that point, no need for Dijkstraâs algorithm.
3. ***Maze* solving problems** are **mostly shortest path problems** and every maze is just a fancy graph so you get the flow.

    Rotting Oranges
    
    You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
        0 representing an empty cell,
        1 representing a fresh orange, or
        2 representing a rotten orange.
    Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
    Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
    
    Example 1:
        Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]

    Example 2:

        Output: -1
        Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
    Example 3:
        Input: grid = [[0,2]]
        Output: 0

## Basic BFS (uses queue)

With queue

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.children = []
        self.name = name

    def breadthFirstSearch(self, array):
        queue = [self]
        while len(queue) > 0:
            curr = queue.pop(0)
            array.append(curr.name)
            for child in curr.children:
                queue.append(child)
        return array
```

## Bidirectional Search *

Bidirectional search is used to find the shortest path between a source and destination node. It operates by essentially **running two simultaneous *breadth-first searches***, one from each node. When their searches collide, we have found a path.

## BFS vs Dijkstra's?

Both are used to find the shortest path 

Dijkstra's is only used on positively weighted graphs

# Quick Select (used to select index)

Based on [Quick Sort](Sorting%20c597de5051f1415793ddcf72086aa93d.md). The QuickSort sorting algorithm works by **picking a "pivot"** number from an array, **positioning every other number in the array in sorted order with respect to the pivot** (all smaller numbers to the pivot's left; all bigger numbers to the pivot's right), and then **repeating the same two steps on both sides of the pivot** until the entire array is sorted. Apply the technique used in Quick Sort until the pivot element gets positioned in the kth place in the array, at which point you'll have found the answer to the problem.

- Quicksort

Pick a random number from the input array (the first number, for instance) and let that number be the pivot. Iterate through the rest of the array using two pointers, one starting at the left extremity of the array and progressively moving to the right, and the other one starting at the right extremity of the array and progressively moving to the left. 

As you iterate through the array, compare the left and right pointer numbers to the pivot. If the left number is greater than the pivot and the right number is less than the pivot, swap them; this will effectively **sort these numbers with respect to the pivot** at the end of the iteration. If the left number is ever less than or equal to the pivot, increment the left pointer; similarly, if the right number is ever greater than or equal to the pivot, decrement the right pointer. 
Do this until the pointers pass each other, at which point **swapping the pivot with the right number should position the pivot in its final, sorted position**, where every number to its left is smaller and every number to its right is greater.

**If the pivot is in the kth position, you're done**; if it isn't, figure out if the kth smallest number is located to the left or to the right of the pivot.

Repeat the process on the **side of the kth smallest number**, and keep on repeating the process thereafter until you find the answer.

### Time Complexity

```python
"""
Best: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array 
Average: O(n) time | O(1) space
Worst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space
"""
